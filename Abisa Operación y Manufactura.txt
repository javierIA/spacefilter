General Terms and Conditions of Sale

1.Scope of General Terms  and Conditions. These General Terms and Conditions  govern  all purchase orders and other contracts  (individually  and collectively,  this 
"Contract") in which buyer ("Buyer") purchases  or accepts goods  or products  (individually,  a "Product" and collectively,  the "Products") from Wacker Chemical 
Corporation  ("Seller").  All other terms  of purchase or sale in any purchase order, order confirmation,  invoice  or other Buyer document  are rejected  unless expressly 
accepted in writing signed by at least two (2) of Seller' s authorized signatories.
2.Payments, Costs, Credit, Quantities,  Orders and Disputed Amounts.  Any pricing  offered,  whether contained  herein or in Seller' s quotes,  order confirmations,  or    other 
documents,  is not considered  a ' firm offer'  under any local, state, or federal law, code,  regulation, rule, or statute. Buyer shall pay for each shipment  of  Products
whether or not Buyer has any claims or defenses  arising out of other shipments.  Seller' s agreement  to ship without payment  is an extension  of credit that   is a 
financial accommodation  to Buyer and may be stopped  or changed  at any time at Seller' s sole discretion.   Buyer shall reimburse  Seller for all taxes, as well as  any 
additional  costs arising from customs,  duties, tariffs, and other governmental  charges that are required to be paid on or that are measured by the sale,  production, 
transportation,  or use of any Products. All orders by Buyer shall be in writing via separate purchase orders. Upon receipt of orders,  Seller issues  acknowledgement  of 
receipt.   All orders are subject to Seller' s acceptance  via an order confirmation  containing  estimated  delivery  dates.  Unless otherwise agreed   to in writing by Seller,
prices  for all orders are contained  in Seller' s order confirmation.   Orders, once confirmed,  cannot be canceled  or modified  without Seller' s  written approval. Should 
Seller so agree, change fees may apply. Seller shall have no obligation  to sell and deliver,  and Buyer shall have no obligation  to purchase,  minimum  quantities  or 
volume of Products, except  as expressly  agreed upon in writing signed by at least two (2) of Seller' s authorized  signatories. Notwithstanding   any language to the 
contrary contained  in the Contract, if a delivery  pursuant to an order confirmation  occurs at a time  when set pricing  is not in effect  (e.g. after the expiration of an
agreed upon or initial price period, if any), the parties shall negotiate updated pricing in good faith. Such previously agreed upon pricing shall not  be binding  upon 
Seller if delivery  is to occur after the expiration  of any previously  agreed upon pricing,  if any. Buyer shall have no right of "set-off"  or withholding  against properly 
payable invoices  issued by Seller or any business  affiliated  with Seller. Payment of the purchase price shall be due at the remittance  address  shown  on the Seller' s
invoice  30 days following  the date of Seller' s invoice  unless otherwise  agreed in writing. Seller may charge interest  at a rate of 1 percent per month   on all balances 
outstanding  past the due date.  Buyer shall pay all of Seller' s reasonable  costs  and expenses  (including  reasonable  collection  agency and attorneys'   fees) to enforce 
and preserve  Seller' s rights hereunder.
3.Defaults. Buyer will be in default of this Contract if any of the following  have occurred: (1) a proceeding  under 11 U.S.C. or any other federal or state insolvency 
law is started by or against Buyer; (2) Buyer fails to pay for any one or more shipments within the time specified; (3) if, in Seller' s estimation,  Buyer appears to be  
insolvent  and/or generally  unable to pay its debts  when due and Buyer cannot provide  adequate assurance of future performance;  or (4) Buyer is otherwise  in breach 
of this Contract. If Buyer defaults,  Seller may: (a) stop extending  credit, change credit terms or place Buyer on "C.I.A."; (b) suspend further shipments  until any 
defaults have been cured and Seller has received assurances of future performance satisfactory to Seller; (c) suspend performance; (d) terminate this Contract; 
and/or (e) pursue any other right or remedy  available at law or in equity. Buyer' s default under this or any other agreement  between  Buyer and Seller shall be  
deemed a default under all agreements between Buyer and Seller until such default is cured. Each of the rights and remedies reserved to Seller in this paragraph 
shall be cumulative,  and Seller' s assertion  of any right or remedy  shall not preclude Seller' s assertion  of any other rights  or remedies.
4.Shipping; Risk of Loss. Unless otherwise  agreed in writing, all Products will be shipped FCA (Incoterms® 2020) from Seller' s location.  Risk of loss shall pass to  
Buyer in accordance  with the applicable Incoterm.   Seller shall retain a security interest  in the Products  until Seller' s receipt  of payment  in full from Buyer.  Any  
delivery dates or lead times  provided  by Seller are estimates  only and subject to change without notification.
5.Suitability of Products Inspection. Determination of the suitability of the Products purchased by Buyer for the use(s) contemplated  by Buyer or Buyer' s customers   is 
the sole responsibility  of Buyer.  Seller' s personnel  may advise  and/or provide  information  on the use and/or application  of Products; however,  any such  
information  is provided  solely for informational  purposes  and must be assessed  and vetted by Buyer. Seller is a raw material supplier only, and as such, does not 
offer consulting  or professional  services. Products sold to Buyer are for Buyer' s internal use only and shall not be resold  unless authorized  in writing by an  
authorized signatory of Seller. In order to mitigate or reduce damages, Buyer is responsible  for ensuring all Products received  conform  to the Contract. Buyer shall 
promptly,  and in any event prior to use and/or comingling,  inspect  Products for any damage to packaging,  shortage, or non-conformance  to this Contract. All 
claims for damage to packaging, shortage, or non-conformance  which could reasonably  be discovered  in the course of such investigation  shall be waived unless 
Buyer notifies  Seller, in writing, within thirty (30) days following  the date of delivery,  describing  the non-conformity  with reasonable  specificity. Failure to 
promptly inspect  the Products and to notify Seller in writing of non-conforming  Products constitutes a waiver of all claims and actions  related to the
non-conformity. Buyer shall do all that is necessary or desirable to preserve nonconforming Products for inspection and testing, to avoid incurring damage for any
nonconforming Products, to cooperate with Seller in implementing the remedies under this Contract, and to protect nonconforming Products until Seller has agreed
to the disposition or care of the nonconforming Products.
6.Compliance with Laws. Buyer agrees to comply with all rules, regulations, ordinances and laws including those relating to Buyer' s use of the Products and shall
reimburse Seller for any costs incurred due to Buyer' s failure to so comply.
7.  Warranties;  Buyer's Remedy; Seller's Liability Limitation. Buyer is responsible  for ensuring  that the Products and specifications are adequate for Buyer' s needs.
Any Products specification changes  shall not bind Seller unless agreed in writing, as evidenced  by a document  signed by at least two (2) of Seller' s authorized   
signatories.Seller warrants that the specifications of the Products will be, at delivery, within the upper and lower limits of those technical data fields 
reflected on the Certificate of Analysis and/or Inspection Certificate, as applicable,  which accompanies the shipment of such Products. SELLER 
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES,  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY SERVICES 
WARRANTIES OR WARRANTIES  OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
Buyer' s exclusive  remedy,  and Seller' s sole liability,  for non-conforming  Products or breach of warranty shall be, at Seller' s option,  replacement  of the
non-conforming  Products at Buyer' s original point of delivery  or refund of the purchase price. Notwithstanding any language herein  to the contrary, Buyer' s  
exclusive  remedy  and Seller' s aggregate liability for any and all suit(s), claim(s) or action(s) against Seller arising out of this Contract, including  but not limited  to  
those  related to delivery  or non-delivery  of product or in tort, is expressly  limited  to the price for the quantity of the Products causing the occurrence  from which 
Buyer claims its damages were caused; and Seller' s total liability under this Contract for all claims,  suits, and actions,  whether based in contract, tort, or any other  
legal theory or otherwise,  shall not exceed  $100,000. IN NO EVENT WILL SELLER BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, 
CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY  DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS CONTRACT, WHETHER BASED IN TORT, 
CONTRACT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, LOSS OF 
SALES, LOSS OF USE, PRODUCTION DELAYS, OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, AND WHETHER OR NOT EITHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. All legal proceedings  by Buyer relating to the Products must be brought within one (1) year following  the date of its 
shipment  or, with respect  to legal proceedings  related to non-delivery,  the requested  delivery  date, and Buyer waives all legal proceedings  not brought within such 
period and all claims and defenses  that could have been asserted  in such proceedings.  Buyer assumes  all risk of liability,  in contract or tort, for consequential 
damages,  property  damage, and personal  injury (including  death) arising in any way from Buyer' s transportation  and storage of the Products and its containers,  use  
of the Products, including but not limited to using the Products in manufacturing, combining the Products with other substances, incorporating the Products in 
Buyer' s finished  good or product, selling Buyer' s finished  good or product, and disposing  of the Products and its containers.   Except  to the extent  of Seller' s willful  
misconduct,  as determined  by a court of competent  jurisdiction,  Buyer shall indemnify,  defend,  and hold Seller and its employees,  shareholders, parents, 
subsidiaries, agents and affiliates  harmless  from all claims,  suits, demands,  and actions  arising out of or in connection  with Buyer' s sale of its own goods  (including   
without limitation  claims  for personal  injury, property  damage, breach of contract, negligence,  strict liability  and intellectual  property  infringement)  and all 
damages,  costs,  and expenses  (including  reasonable  attorney' s fees  and other legal expenses)  arising therefrom.   This provision  shall survive termination  of this  
Contract and delivery,  use, and application  of the Products.
8. Force Majeure; Allocation. Seller shall not be liable for the delay of or failure to meet its obligations under this Contract, or the consequences to Buyer, arising

WCC Terms & Conditions Rev. 7

Page 3 of 4

from any event beyond  Seller' s control,  including  but not limited  to: inability to obtain (on terms deemed  economically  and commercially  practicable by Seller) raw  
materials, fuel or transportation; fire, floods, inclement weather and other acts of God; strikes, lockouts or other work stoppages; wars; sabotage; accidents; plant 
shut down;  equipment  failure; currency fluctuation or manipulation;  production  decisions  not made by Wacker Chemical  Corporation;  and voluntary or involuntary 
compliance with any law. During the period of delay, and in any other times of shortage, Seller is relieved from its obligations hereunder and may allocate 
available Products in a fair and reasonable  manner, as Seller determines  in its sole discretion,  without the obligation  to obtain cover, or similar products,  from other 
sources. Seller shall have the right to satisfy its own requirements and the requirements of its parent, subsidiary and affiliate companies first. Seller shall endeavor 
to, but has no obligation  to, provide notice of any such shortages by issuing  a notice of allocation, which may include Product allotment and/or caps.
9.Successors and Assigns. This Contract shall be binding  upon and inure to the benefit  of the respective  parties' successors  and assigns. Neither party may assign 
this Contract without the prior written consent  of the other, which shall not be unreasonably  withheld.
10.Governing  Law; Arbitration. The laws of the State of Tennessee  will govern the interpretation  and enforcement  of this Contract. Any dispute  or controversy 
arising out of or related to this Contract,  other than claims for specific  performance  or injunctive  relief, shall be resolved  by binding  arbitration, in Hamilton 
County, Tennessee,  or such other location agreed upon by Buyer and Seller, in accordance  with the Commercial  Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration 
Association  in effect  at the time of the demand for arbitration. Except with respect  to the foregoing  , the parties agree to exclusively  bring, file, and litigate any 
claims,  suits, or actions  arising from this Contract or related to the Products in state or federal courts of Hamilton County, Tennessee.  The parties hereby  disclaim 
the United Nations Convention  on Contracts for the International  Sale of Goods and expressly  agree the same does  not apply to the Agreement  or the sale of any 
Products by Seller. Unless  authorized in writing by the Chief  Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of Seller, the sales hereunder are not subject to 
federal or state contractor status, and the rules and regulations applicable thereto are not contemplated or applicable to Seller or the sale of Product(s) hereunder.
11.Proprietary Rights; Confidentiality. All designs, drawings, specifications, samples and such other proprietary information, whether or not marked as such, made
available by Seller shall be and remain the legal property of Seller, and shall be held confidential by Buyer. Buyer acknowledges Seller' s right to injunctive relief
with respect to the foregoing. Buyer will cease to use such proprietary information upon termination of this Contract and will promptly return to Seller any and all
such designs, drawings, specifications, and all other confidential information and data furnished.
12.Patent Infringement; WACKER Trademarks.  Seller shall, at its own expense,  defend  and control  any suit against Buyer for infringement  of any United States 
Letters  Patent alleging the manufacture of the Products infringe  any United States Letters  Patent, and shall pay any award of damages assessed  against Buyer in the 
suit to the extent  only that the damages are awarded in connection  specifically  with the alleged infringement; however,  the foregoing  obligations  shall not arise 
unless  Buyer gives  Seller prompt notice  in writing of the institution  of the suit and, to the full extent  of Buyer' s power to do so, Buyer permits  Seller to defend  and  
control  the suit against these allegations. If a suit or claim results in any injunction  or order that would reasonably  prevent  Seller from supplying  any Product, Seller 
may, at its option:  (i) secure an appropriate license to permit  Seller to continue  supplying those  Products; (ii) modify  the appropriate Product so that it becomes
non-infringing;  (iii) replace the appropriate Product with a non-infringing  but practically equivalent  Product; or (iv) provide  a refund in the amount of the purchase 
price to Buyer for any Product Buyer has in inventory  at the time and is prevented  from using. The above fully expresses  Buyer' s exclusive  remedy  and Seller' s  
sole responsibility  with respect  to infringement  or alleged infringement  of any intellectual  property  rights by the Products, and SELLER EXPRESSLY 
DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER WRITTEN OR UNWRITTEN, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WARRANTY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT with respect  to the Products.
Buyer understands  and agrees that all WACKER branding  and product names,  including  those  owned  by Seller and/or any of its affiliates,  are trademarks and 
subject to protection  under the law as such, even if the ® demarcation  is not used. Such branding,  names, and trademarks may not be used without written 
permission of Seller.
13.Product Improvement; Consolidation; Cessation. Seller may, without liability  or obligation  and at any time: (i) cease or discontinue  the manufacture and/or  sale of 
any of the Products;(ii) consolidate  Products with other of Seller' s products;  (iii) introduce  new versions of any Product; and/or (iv) make iterative changes  in  
Product manufacture (including  location,  method,  and raw materials).  Seller shall endeavor  to provide  notice  of any such cessation  or discontinuation;  however, 
advance notice may not be possible,  especially  if such action is prompted  by a governmental  directive  or suggestion,  or if undertaken for the purpose  of 
safeguarding human health or safety.
14.Prohibited Parties. Neither Buyer nor any person  that directly  or indirectly  owns  10% or more of the outstanding  equity in Buyer (collectively,  the "Buyer 
Persons") is, or has been determined  by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury to be acting on behalf of, a Specifically Designated National and Blocked Person, or has 
otherwise  been designated as (i) a person or entity with whom an entity organized under the laws of the United States is prohibited from entering into transactions 
or (ii) from whom such an entity  is prohibited  from receiving  money  or other property  or interests  in property,  pursuant to Executive  Orders, regulations 
promulgated  by the United States Treasury Department' s Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"),  or otherwise.  In addition,  no Buyer Person is located in, or  
operating  from, a country subject to U.S. economic  sanctions  administered  by OFAC. Should Buyer be found in violation  of any of the aforementioned  obligations, 
Seller may immediately  suspend sales and shipments  to any and all Buyer facilities  and terminate  this Agreement without liability and Buyer will indemnify  Seller 
for all costs  and liabilities  arising from such violation.

8. Force Majeure; Allocation. Seller shall not be liable for the delay of or failure to meet its obligations under this Contract, or the consequences to Buyer, arising

WCC Terms & Conditions Rev. 7

from any event beyond Seller' s control, including but not limited to: inability to obtain (on terms deemed economically and commercially practicable by Seller) raw
materials, fuel or transportation; fire, floods, inclement weather and other acts of God; strikes, lockouts or other work stoppages; wars; sabotage; accidents; plant
shut down; equipment failure; currency fluctuation or manipulation; production decisions not made by Wacker Chemical Corporation; and voluntary or involuntary
compliance with any law.  During the period of delay, and in any other times of shortage, Seller is relieved from its obligations hereunder and may allocate
available Products in a fair and reasonable manner,  as Seller determines in its sole discretion, without the obligation to obtain cover, or similar products, from other
sources.  Seller shall have the right to satisfy its own requirements and the requirements of its parent, subsidiary and affiliate companies first. Seller shall endeavor
to, but has no obligation to, provide notice of any such shortages by issuing a notice of allocation, which may include Product allotment and/or caps.
9. Successors and Assigns.  This Contract shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective parties'  successors and assigns.  Neither party may assign
this Contract without the prior written consent of the other, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
10. Governing Law; Arbitration.  The laws of the State of Tennessee will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Contract. Any dispute or controversy
arising out of or related to this Contract, other than claims for specific performance or injunctive relief, shall be resolved by binding arbitration, in Hamilton
County, Tennessee, or such other location agreed upon by Buyer and Seller, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association in effect at the time of the demand for arbitration.  Except with respect to the foregoing , the parties agree to exclusively bring, file, and litigate  any
claims, suits, or actions arising from this Contract or related to the Products in state or federal courts of Hamilton County, Tennessee. The parties hereby disclaim
the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and expressly agree the same does not apply to the Agreement or the sale of any
Products by Seller. Unless authorized in writing by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of Seller, the sales hereunder are not subject to
federal or state contractor status, and the rules and regulations applicable thereto are not contemplated or applicable to Seller or the sale of Product(s) hereunder.
11. Proprietary Rights; Confidentiality. All designs, drawings, specifications, samples and such other proprietary information, whether or not marked as such, made
available by Seller shall be and remain the legal property of Seller, and shall be held confidential by Buyer.  Buyer acknowledges Seller' s right to injunctive relief
with respect to the foregoing.  Buyer will cease to use such proprietary information upon termination of this Contract and will promptly return to Seller any and all
such designs, drawings, specifications, and all other confidential information and data furnished.
12. Patent Infringement; WACKER Trademarks. Seller shall, at its own expense, defend and control any suit against Buyer for infringement of any United States
Letters Patent alleging the manufacture of the Products infringe any United States Letters Patent, and shall pay any award of damages assessed against Buyer in the
suit to the extent only that the damages are awarded in connection specifically with the alleged infringement;  however, the foregoing obligations shall not arise
unless Buyer gives Seller prompt notice in writing of the institution of the suit and, to the full extent of Buyer' s power to do so, Buyer permits Seller to defend and
control the suit against these allegations.  If a suit or claim results in any injunction or order that would reasonably prevent Seller from supplying any Product, Seller
may, at its option: (i) secure an appropriate license to permit Seller to continue supplying those Products; (ii) modify the appropriate Product so that it becomes
non-infringing; (iii) replace the appropriate Product with a non-infringing but practically equivalent Product; or (iv) provide a refund in the amount of the purchase
price to Buyer for any Product Buyer has in inventory at the time and is prevented from using. The above fully expresses Buyer' s exclusive remedy and Seller' s
sole responsibility with respect to infringement or alleged infringement of any intellectual property rights by the Products, and SELLER EXPRESSLY
DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER WRITTEN OR UNWRITTEN, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WARRANTY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT with respect to the Products.
Buyer understands and agrees that all WACKER branding and product names, including those owned by Seller and/or any of its affiliates, are trademarks and
subject to protection under the law as such, even if the ® demarcation is not used. Such branding, names, and trademarks may not be used without written
permission of Seller.
13. Product Improvement; Consolidation; Cessation.  Seller may, without liability or obligation and at any time: (i) cease or discontinue the manufacture and/or sale of
any of the Products;(ii) consolidate Products with other of Seller' s products; (iii) introduce new versions of any Product; and/or (iv) make iterative changes in
Product manufacture (including location, method, and raw materials). Seller shall endeavor to provide notice of any such cessation or discontinuation; however,
advance notice may not be possible, especially if such action is prompted by a governmental directive or suggestion, or if undertaken for the purpose of
safeguarding human health or safety.
14. Prohibited Parties.  Neither Buyer nor any person that directly or indirectly owns 10% or more of the outstanding equity in Buyer (collectively, the "Buyer
Persons") is, or has been determined by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury to be acting on behalf of, a Specifically Designated National and Blocked Person, or has
otherwise been designated as (i) a person or entity with whom an entity organized under the laws of the United States is prohibited from entering into transactions
or (ii) from whom such an entity is prohibited from receiving money or other property or interests in property, pursuant to Executive Orders, regulations
promulgated by the United States Treasury Department' s Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"), or otherwise. In addition, no Buyer Person is located in, or
operating from, a country subject to U.S. economic sanctions administered by OFAC. Should Buyer be found in violation of any of the aforementioned obligations,
Seller may immediately suspend sales and shipments to any and all Buyer facilities and terminate this Agreement without liability and Buyer will indemnify Seller
for all costs and liabilities arising from such violation.

General Terms and Conditions of Sale
1.  Scope of General Terms and Conditions.  These General Terms and Conditions govern all purchase orders and other contracts (individually and collectively, this
"Contract") in which buyer ("Buyer") purchases or accepts goods or products (individually, a "Product" and collectively, the "Products") from Wacker Chemical
Corporation ("Seller"). All other terms of purchase or sale in any purchase order, order confirmation, invoice or other Buyer document are rejected unless expressly
accepted in writing signed by at least two (2) of Seller's authorized signatories.
2.  Payments, Costs, Credit, Quantities, Orders and Disputed Amounts.  Any pricing offered, whether contained herein or in Seller's quotes, order confirmations, or
other documents, is not considered a 'firm offer' under any local, state, or federal law, code, regulation, rule, or statute. Buyer shall pay for each shipment of
Products whether or not Buyer has any claims or defenses arising out of other shipments.  Seller's agreement to ship without payment is an extension of credit that
is a financial accommodation to Buyer and may be stopped or changed at any time at Seller's sole discretion.  Buyer shall reimburse Seller for all taxes, as well as
any additional costs arising from customs, duties, tariffs,  and other governmental charges that are required to be paid on or that are measured by the sale,
production, transportation, or use of any Products. All orders by Buyer shall be in writing via separate purchase orders.  Upon receipt of orders, Seller issues
acknowledgement of receipt.  All orders are subject to Seller's acceptance via an order confirmation containing estimated delivery dates.  Unless otherwise agreed
to in writing by Seller, prices for all orders are contained in Seller's order confirmation.  Orders, once confirmed, cannot be canceled or modified without Seller's
written approval.  Should Seller so agree, change fees may apply.  Seller shall have no obligation to sell and deliver, and Buyer shall have no obligation to purchase,
minimum quantities or volume of Products, except as expressly agreed upon in writing signed by at least two (2) of Seller's authorized signatories. Notwithstanding
any language to the contrary contained in the Contract, if a delivery pursuant to an order confirmation occurs at a time when set pricing is not in effect (e.g. after the
expiration of an agreed upon or initial price period, if any), the parties shall negotiate updated pricing in good faith. Such previously agreed upon pricing shall not
be binding upon Seller if delivery is to occur after the expiration of any previously agreed upon pricing, if any. Buyer shall have no right of "set-off" or withholding
against properly payable invoices issued by Seller or any business affiliated with Seller.  Payment of the purchase price shall be due at the remittance address shown
on the Seller's invoice 30 days following the date of Seller's invoice unless otherwise agreed in writing. Seller may charge interest at a rate of 1 percent per month
on all balances outstanding past the due date.  Buyer shall pay all of Seller's reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable collection agency and attorneys'
fees) to enforce and preserve Seller's rights hereunder.
3.  Defaults.  Buyer will be in default of this Contract if any of the following have occurred: (1) a proceeding under 11 U.S.C. or any other federal or state insolvency
law is started by or against Buyer; (2) Buyer fails to pay for any one or more shipments within the time specified; (3) if, in Seller's estimation, Buyer appears to be
insolvent and/or generally unable to pay its debts when due and Buyer cannot provide adequate assurance of future performance; or (4) Buyer is otherwise in breach
of this Contract. If Buyer defaults, Seller may: (a) stop extending credit, change credit terms or place Buyer on "C.I.A."; (b) suspend further shipments until any
defaults have been cured and Seller has received assurances of future performance satisfactory to Seller; (c) suspend performance; (d) terminate this Contract;
and/or (e) pursue any other right or remedy available at law or in equity. Buyer's default under this or any other agreement between Buyer and Seller shall be
deemed a default under all agreements between Buyer and Seller until such default is cured. Each of the rights and remedies reserved to Seller in this paragraph
shall be cumulative, and Seller's assertion of any right or remedy shall not preclude Seller's assertion of any other rights or remedies.
4.  Shipping; Risk of Loss. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, all Products will be shipped FCA (Incoterms® 2020) from Seller's location. Risk of loss shall pass to
Buyer in accordance with the applicable Incoterm.  Seller shall retain a security interest in the Products until Seller's receipt of payment in full from Buyer.  Any
delivery dates or lead times provided by Seller are estimates only and subject to change without notification.
5.  Suitability of Products Inspection. Determination of the suitability of the Products purchased by Buyer for the use(s) contemplated by Buyer or Buyer's customers
is the sole responsibility of Buyer.  Seller's personnel may advise and/or provide information on the use and/or application of Products; however, any such
information is provided solely for informational purposes and must be assessed and vetted by Buyer.  Seller is a raw material supplier only, and as such, does not
offer consulting or professional services. Products sold to Buyer are for Buyer's internal use only and shall not be resold unless authorized in writing by an
authorized signatory of Seller. In order to mitigate or reduce damages, Buyer is responsible for ensuring all Products received conform to the Contract.  Buyer shall
promptly, and in any event prior to use and/or comingling, inspect Products for any damage to packaging, shortage, or non-conformance to this Contract.  All
claims for damage to packaging, shortage, or non-conformance which could reasonably be discovered in the course of such investigation shall be waived unless
Buyer notifies Seller, in writing, within thirty (30) days following the date of delivery, describing the non-conformity with reasonable specificity.  Failure to
promptly inspect the Products and to notify Seller in writing of non-conforming Products constitutes a waiver of all claims and actions related to the
non-conformity. Buyer shall do all that is necessary or desirable to preserve nonconforming Products for inspection and testing, to avoid incurring damage for any
nonconforming Products, to cooperate with Seller in implementing the remedies under this Contract, and to protect nonconforming Products until Seller has agreed
to the disposition or care of the nonconforming Products.
6.  Compliance with Laws. Buyer agrees to comply with all rules, regulations, ordinances and laws including those relating to Buyer's use of the Products and shall
reimburse Seller for any costs incurred due to Buyer's failure to so comply.
7.  Warranties; Buyer's Remedy; Seller's Liability Limitation.   Buyer is responsible for ensuring that the Products and specifications are adequate for Buyer's needs.
Any Products specification changes shall not bind Seller unless agreed in writing, as evidenced by a document signed by at least two (2) of Seller's authorized
signatories.Seller warrants that the specifications of the Products will be, at delivery, within the upper and lower limits of those technical data fields
reflected on the Certificate of Analysis and/or Inspection Certificate, as applicable, which accompanies the shipment of such Products.  SELLER
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY SERVICES
WARRANTIES OR WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 
Buyer's exclusive remedy, and Seller's sole liability, for non-conforming Products or breach of warranty shall be, at Seller's option, replacement of the
non-conforming Products at Buyer's original point of delivery or refund of the purchase price. Notwithstanding any language herein to the contrary, Buyer's
exclusive remedy and Seller's aggregate liability for any and all suit(s), claim(s) or action(s) against Seller arising out of this Contract, including but not limited to
those related to delivery or non-delivery of product or in tort, is expressly limited to the price for the quantity of the Products causing the occurrence from which
Buyer claims its damages were caused; and Seller's total liability under this Contract for all claims, suits, and actions, whether based in contract, tort, or any other
legal theory or otherwise, shall not exceed $100,000.  IN NO EVENT WILL SELLER BE LIABLE  FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS CONTRACT, WHETHER BASED IN TORT,
CONTRACT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, LOSS OF
SALES, LOSS OF USE, PRODUCTION DELAYS, OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, AND WHETHER OR NOT EITHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. All legal proceedings by Buyer relating to the Products must be brought within one (1) year following the date of its
shipment or, with respect to legal proceedings related to non-delivery, the requested delivery date, and Buyer waives all legal proceedings not brought within such
period and all claims and defenses that could have been asserted in such proceedings. Buyer assumes all risk of liability, in contract or tort, for consequential
damages, property damage, and personal injury (including death) arising in any way from Buyer's transportation and storage of the Products and its containers, use
of the Products, including but not limited to using the Products in manufacturing, combining the Products with other substances, incorporating the Products in
Buyer's finished good or product, selling Buyer's finished good or product, and disposing of the Products and its containers.  Except to the extent of Seller's willful
misconduct, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, Buyer shall indemnify, defend, and hold Seller and its employees, shareholders, parents,
subsidiaries, agents and affiliates harmless from all claims, suits, demands, and actions arising out of or in connection with Buyer's sale of its own goods (including
without limitation claims for personal injury,  property damage, breach of contract, negligence, strict liability and intellectual property infringement) and all
damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and other legal expenses) arising therefrom.  This provision shall survive termination of this
Contract and delivery, use, and application of the Products.
8.  Force Majeure; Allocation. Seller shall not be liable for the delay of or failure to meet its obligations under this Contract, or the consequences to Buyer, arising
WCC Terms & Conditions Rev. 7  

               Page 3  of    4

from any event beyond Seller's control, including but not limited to: inability to obtain (on terms deemed economically and commercially practicable by Seller) raw
materials, fuel or transportation; fire, floods, inclement weather and other acts of God; strikes, lockouts or other work stoppages; wars; sabotage; accidents; plant
shut down; equipment failure; currency fluctuation or manipulation; production decisions not made by Wacker Chemical Corporation; and voluntary or involuntary
compliance with any law.  During the period of delay, and in any other times of shortage, Seller is relieved from its obligations hereunder and may allocate
available Products in a fair and reasonable manner,  as Seller determines in its sole discretion, without the obligation to obtain cover, or similar products, from other
sources.  Seller shall have the right to satisfy its own requirements and the requirements of its parent, subsidiary and affiliate companies first. Seller shall endeavor
to, but has no obligation to, provide notice of any such shortages by issuing a notice of allocation, which may include Product allotment and/or caps.
9.  Successors and Assigns.  This Contract shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective parties' successors and assigns.  Neither party may assign
this Contract without the prior written consent of the other, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
10. Governing Law; Arbitration.  The laws of the State of Tennessee will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Contract.  Any dispute or controversy
arising out of or related to this Contract, other than claims for specific performance or injunctive relief, shall be resolved by binding arbitration, in Hamilton
County, Tennessee, or such other location agreed upon by Buyer and Seller, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association in effect at the time of the demand for arbitration.  Except with respect to the foregoing , the parties agree to exclusively bring, file, and litigate  any
claims, suits, or actions arising from this Contract or related to the Products in state or federal courts of Hamilton County, Tennessee. The parties hereby disclaim
the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and expressly agree the same does not apply to the Agreement or the sale of any
Products by Seller. Unless authorized in writing by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of Seller, the sales hereunder are not subject to
federal or state contractor status, and the rules and regulations applicable thereto are not contemplated or applicable to Seller or the sale of Product(s) hereunder.
11.  Proprietary Rights; Confidentiality. All designs, drawings, specifications, samples and such other proprietary information, whether or not marked as such, made
available by Seller shall be and remain the legal property of Seller, and shall be held confidential by Buyer.  Buyer acknowledges Seller's right to injunctive relief

sole responsibility with respect to infringement or alleged infringement of any intellectual property rights by the Products, and SELLER EXPRESSLY

Buyer understands and agrees that all WACKER branding and product names, including those owned by Seller and/or any of its affiliates, are trademarks and

Persons") is, or has been determined by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury to be acting on behalf of, a Specifically Designated National and Blocked Person, or has
otherwise been designated as (i) a person or entity with whom an entity organized under the laws of the United States is prohibited from entering into transactions
or (ii) from whom such an entity is prohibited from receiving money or other property or interests in property, pursuant to Executive Orders, regulations

General Terms and Conditions of Sale
1.  Scope of General Terms and Conditions.  These General Terms and Conditions govern all purchase orders and other contracts (individually and collectively, this
"Contract") in which buyer ("Buyer") purchases or accepts goods or products (individually, a "Product" and collectively, the "Products") from Wacker Chemical
Corporation ("Seller"). All other terms of purchase or sale in any purchase order, order confirmation, invoice or other Buyer document are rejected unless expressly
accepted in writing signed by at least two (2) of Seller's authorized signatories.
2.  Payments, Costs, Credit, Quantities, Orders and Disputed Amounts.  Any pricing offered, whether contained herein or in Seller's quotes, order confirmations, or
other documents, is not considered a 'firm offer' under any local, state, or federal law, code, regulation, rule, or statute. Buyer shall pay for each shipment of
Products whether or not Buyer has any claims or defenses arising out of other shipments.  Seller's agreement to ship without payment is an extension of credit that
is a financial accommodation to Buyer and may be stopped or changed at any time at Seller's sole discretion.  Buyer shall reimburse Seller for all taxes, as well as
any additional costs arising from customs, duties, tariffs,  and other governmental charges that are required to be paid on or that are measured by the sale,
production, transportation, or use of any Products. All orders by Buyer shall be in writing via separate purchase orders.  Upon receipt of orders, Seller issues
acknowledgement of receipt.  All orders are subject to Seller's acceptance via an order confirmation containing estimated delivery dates.  Unless otherwise agreed
to in writing by Seller, prices for all orders are contained in Seller's order confirmation.  Orders, once confirmed, cannot be canceled or modified without Seller's
written approval.  Should Seller so agree, change fees may apply.  Seller shall have no obligation to sell and deliver, and Buyer shall have no obligation to purchase,
minimum quantities or volume of Products, except as expressly agreed upon in writing signed by at least two (2) of Seller's authorized signatories. Notwithstanding
any language to the contrary contained in the Contract, if a delivery pursuant to an order confirmation occurs at a time when set pricing is not in effect (e.g. after the
expiration of an agreed upon or initial price period, if any), the parties shall negotiate updated pricing in good faith. Such previously agreed upon pricing shall not
be binding upon Seller if delivery is to occur after the expiration of any previously agreed upon pricing, if any. Buyer shall have no right of "set-off" or withholding
against properly payable invoices issued by Seller or any business affiliated with Seller.  Payment of the purchase price shall be due at the remittance address shown
on the Seller's invoice 30 days following the date of Seller's invoice unless otherwise agreed in writing. Seller may charge interest at a rate of 1 percent per month
on all balances outstanding past the due date.  Buyer shall pay all of Seller's reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable collection agency and attorneys'
fees) to enforce and preserve Seller's rights hereunder.
3.  Defaults.  Buyer will be in default of this Contract if any of the following have occurred: (1) a proceeding under 11 U.S.C. or any other federal or state insolvency
law is started by or against Buyer; (2) Buyer fails to pay for any one or more shipments within the time specified; (3) if, in Seller's estimation, Buyer appears to be
insolvent and/or generally unable to pay its debts when due and Buyer cannot provide adequate assurance of future performance; or (4) Buyer is otherwise in breach
of this Contract. If Buyer defaults, Seller may: (a) stop extending credit, change credit terms or place Buyer on "C.I.A."; (b) suspend further shipments until any
defaults have been cured and Seller has received assurances of future performance satisfactory to Seller; (c) suspend performance; (d) terminate this Contract;
and/or (e) pursue any other right or remedy available at law or in equity. Buyer's default under this or any other agreement between Buyer and Seller shall be
deemed a default under all agreements between Buyer and Seller until such default is cured. Each of the rights and remedies reserved to Seller in this paragraph
shall be cumulative, and Seller's assertion of any right or remedy shall not preclude Seller's assertion of any other rights or remedies.
4.  Shipping; Risk of Loss. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, all Products will be shipped FCA (Incoterms® 2020) from Seller's location. Risk of loss shall pass to
Buyer in accordance with the applicable Incoterm.  Seller shall retain a security interest in the Products until Seller's receipt of payment in full from Buyer.  Any
delivery dates or lead times provided by Seller are estimates only and subject to change without notification.
5.  Suitability of Products Inspection. Determination of the suitability of the Products purchased by Buyer for the use(s) contemplated by Buyer or Buyer's customers
is the sole responsibility of Buyer.  Seller's personnel may advise and/or provide information on the use and/or application of Products; however, any such
information is provided solely for informational purposes and must be assessed and vetted by Buyer.  Seller is a raw material supplier only, and as such, does not
offer consulting or professional services. Products sold to Buyer are for Buyer's internal use only and shall not be resold unless authorized in writing by an
authorized signatory of Seller. In order to mitigate or reduce damages, Buyer is responsible for ensuring all Products received conform to the Contract.  Buyer shall
promptly, and in any event prior to use and/or comingling, inspect Products for any damage to packaging, shortage, or non-conformance to this Contract.  All
claims for damage to packaging, shortage, or non-conformance which could reasonably be discovered in the course of such investigation shall be waived unless
Buyer notifies Seller, in writing, within thirty (30) days following the date of delivery, describing the non-conformity with reasonable specificity.  Failure to
promptly inspect the Products and to notify Seller in writing of non-conforming Products constitutes a waiver of all claims and actions related to the
non-conformity. Buyer shall do all that is necessary or desirable to preserve nonconforming Products for inspection and testing, to avoid incurring damage for any
nonconforming Products, to cooperate with Seller in implementing the remedies under this Contract, and to protect nonconforming Products until Seller has agreed
to the disposition or care of the nonconforming Products.
6.  Compliance with Laws. Buyer agrees to comply with all rules, regulations, ordinances and laws including those relating to Buyer's use of the Products and shall
reimburse Seller for any costs incurred due to Buyer's failure to so comply.
7.  Warranties; Buyer's Remedy; Seller's Liability Limitation.   Buyer is responsible for ensuring that the Products and specifications are adequate for Buyer's needs.
Any Products specification changes shall not bind Seller unless agreed in writing, as evidenced by a document signed by at least two (2) of Seller's authorized
signatories.Seller warrants that the specifications of the Products will be, at delivery, within the upper and lower limits of those technical data fields
reflected on the Certificate of Analysis and/or Inspection Certificate, as applicable, which accompanies the shipment of such Products.  SELLER
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY SERVICES
WARRANTIES OR WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 
Buyer's exclusive remedy, and Seller's sole liability, for non-conforming Products or breach of warranty shall be, at Seller's option, replacement of the
non-conforming Products at Buyer's original point of delivery or refund of the purchase price. Notwithstanding any language herein to the contrary, Buyer's
exclusive remedy and Seller's aggregate liability for any and all suit(s), claim(s) or action(s) against Seller arising out of this Contract, including but not limited to
those related to delivery or non-delivery of product or in tort, is expressly limited to the price for the quantity of the Products causing the occurrence from which
Buyer claims its damages were caused; and Seller's total liability under this Contract for all claims, suits, and actions, whether based in contract, tort, or any other
legal theory or otherwise, shall not exceed $100,000.  IN NO EVENT WILL SELLER BE LIABLE  FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS CONTRACT, WHETHER BASED IN TORT,
CONTRACT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, LOSS OF
SALES, LOSS OF USE, PRODUCTION DELAYS, OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, AND WHETHER OR NOT EITHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. All legal proceedings by Buyer relating to the Products must be brought within one (1) year following the date of its
shipment or, with respect to legal proceedings related to non-delivery, the requested delivery date, and Buyer waives all legal proceedings not brought within such
period and all claims and defenses that could have been asserted in such proceedings. Buyer assumes all risk of liability, in contract or tort, for consequential
damages, property damage, and personal injury (including death) arising in any way from Buyer's transportation and storage of the Products and its containers, use
of the Products, including but not limited to using the Products in manufacturing, combining the Products with other substances, incorporating the Products in
Buyer's finished good or product, selling Buyer's finished good or product, and disposing of the Products and its containers.  Except to the extent of Seller's willful
misconduct, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, Buyer shall indemnify, defend, and hold Seller and its employees, shareholders, parents,
subsidiaries, agents and affiliates harmless from all claims, suits, demands, and actions arising out of or in connection with Buyer's sale of its own goods (including
without limitation claims for personal injury,  property damage, breach of contract, negligence, strict liability and intellectual property infringement) and all
damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and other legal expenses) arising therefrom.  This provision shall survive termination of this
Contract and delivery, use, and application of the Products.
8.  Force Majeure; Allocation. Seller shall not be liable for the delay of or failure to meet its obligations under this Contract, or the consequences to Buyer, arising
WCC Terms & Conditions Rev. 7  

               Page 3  of    4

from any event beyond Seller's control, including but not limited to: inability to obtain (on terms deemed economically and commercially practicable by Seller) raw
materials, fuel or transportation; fire, floods, inclement weather and other acts of God; strikes, lockouts or other work stoppages; wars; sabotage; accidents; plant
shut down; equipment failure; currency fluctuation or manipulation; production decisions not made by Wacker Chemical Corporation; and voluntary or involuntary
compliance with any law.  During the period of delay, and in any other times of shortage, Seller is relieved from its obligations hereunder and may allocate
available Products in a fair and reasonable manner,  as Seller determines in its sole discretion, without the obligation to obtain cover, or similar products, from other
sources.  Seller shall have the right to satisfy its own requirements and the requirements of its parent, subsidiary and affiliate companies first. Seller shall endeavor
to, but has no obligation to, provide notice of any such shortages by issuing a notice of allocation, which may include Product allotment and/or caps.
9.  Successors and Assigns.  This Contract shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective parties' successors and assigns.  Neither party may assign
this Contract without the prior written consent of the other, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
10. Governing Law; Arbitration.  The laws of the State of Tennessee will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Contract.  Any dispute or controversy
arising out of or related to this Contract, other than claims for specific performance or injunctive relief, shall be resolved by binding arbitration, in Hamilton
County, Tennessee, or such other location agreed upon by Buyer and Seller, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association in effect at the time of the demand for arbitration.  Except with respect to the foregoing , the parties agree to exclusively bring, file, and litigate  any
claims, suits, or actions arising from this Contract or related to the Products in state or federal courts of Hamilton County, Tennessee. The parties hereby disclaim
the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and expressly agree the same does not apply to the Agreement or the sale of any
Products by Seller. Unless authorized in writing by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of Seller, the sales hereunder are not subject to
federal or state contractor status, and the rules and regulations applicable thereto are not contemplated or applicable to Seller or the sale of Product(s) hereunder.
11.  Proprietary Rights; Confidentiality. All designs, drawings, specifications, samples and such other proprietary information, whether or not marked as such, made
available by Seller shall be and remain the legal property of Seller, and shall be held confidential by Buyer.  Buyer acknowledges Seller's right to injunctive relief
with respect to the foregoing.  Buyer will cease to use such proprietary information upon termination of this Contract and will promptly return to Seller any and all
such designs, drawings, specifications, and all other confidential information and data furnished.
12. Patent Infringement; WACKER Trademarks. Seller shall, at its own expense, defend and control any suit against Buyer for infringement of any United States
Letters Patent alleging the manufacture of the Products infringe any United States Letters Patent, and shall pay any award of damages assessed against Buyer in the
suit to the extent only that the damages are awarded in connection specifically with the alleged infringement;  however, the foregoing obligations shall not arise
unless Buyer gives Seller prompt notice in writing of the institution of the suit and, to the full extent of Buyer's power to do so, Buyer permits Seller to defend and
control the suit against these allegations.  If a suit or claim results in any injunction or order that would reasonably prevent Seller from supplying any Product, Seller
may, at its option: (i) secure an appropriate license to permit Seller to continue supplying those Products; (ii) modify the appropriate Product so that it becomes
non-infringing; (iii) replace the appropriate Product with a non-infringing but practically equivalent Product; or (iv) provide a refund in the amount of the purchase
price to Buyer for any Product Buyer has in inventory at the time and is prevented from using. The above fully expresses Buyer's exclusive remedy and Seller's
sole responsibility with respect to infringement or alleged infringement of any intellectual property rights by the Products, and SELLER EXPRESSLY
DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER WRITTEN OR UNWRITTEN, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WARRANTY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT with respect to the Products.
Buyer understands and agrees that all WACKER branding and product names, including those owned by Seller and/or any of its affiliates, are trademarks and
subject to protection under the law as such, even if the ® demarcation is not used. Such branding, names, and trademarks may not be used without written
permission of Seller.
13. Product Improvement; Consolidation; Cessation.  Seller may, without liability or obligation and at any time: (i) cease or discontinue the manufacture and/or sale of
any of the Products;(ii) consolidate Products with other of Seller's products; (iii) introduce new versions of any Product; and/or (iv) make iterative changes in
Product manufacture (including location, method, and raw materials). Seller shall endeavor to provide notice of any such cessation or discontinuation; however,
advance notice may not be possible, especially if such action is prompted by a governmental directive or suggestion, or if undertaken for the purpose of
safeguarding human health or safety.
14. Prohibited Parties.  Neither Buyer nor any person that directly or indirectly owns 10% or more of the outstanding equity in Buyer (collectively, the "Buyer
Persons") is, or has been determined by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury to be acting on behalf of, a Specifically Designated National and Blocked Person, or has
otherwise been designated as (i) a person or entity with whom an entity organized under the laws of the United States is prohibited from entering into transactions
or (ii) from whom such an entity is prohibited from receiving money or other property or interests in property, pursuant to Executive Orders, regulations
promulgated by the United States Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"), or otherwise. In addition, no Buyer Person is located in, or
operating from, a country subject to U.S. economic sanctions administered by OFAC. Should Buyer be found in violation of any of the aforementioned obligations,
Seller may immediately suspend sales and shipments to any and all Buyer facilities and terminate this Agreement without liability and Buyer will indemnify Seller
for all costs and liabilities arising from such violation.

1.  Scope of General Terms and Conditions.  These General Terms and Conditions govern all purchase orders and other contracts (individually and collectively, this
"Contract") in which buyer ("Buyer") purchases or accepts goods or products (individually, a "Product" and collectively, the "Products") from Wacker Chemical

exclusive remedy and Seller's aggregate liability for any and all suit(s), claim(s) or action(s) against Seller arising out of this Contract, including but not limited to
those related to delivery or non-delivery of product or in tort, is expressly limited to the price for the quantity of the Products causing the occurrence from which
Buyer claims its damages were caused; and Seller's total liability under this Contract for all claims, suits, and actions, whether based in contract, tort, or any other
legal theory or otherwise, shall not exceed $100,000.  IN NO EVENT WILL SELLER BE LIABLE  FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS CONTRACT, WHETHER BASED IN TORT,
CONTRACT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, LOSS OF
SALES, LOSS OF USE, PRODUCTION DELAYS, OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, AND WHETHER OR NOT EITHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. All legal proceedings by Buyer relating to the Products must be brought within one (1) year following the date of its
shipment or, with respect to legal proceedings related to non-delivery, the requested delivery date, and Buyer waives all legal proceedings not brought within such
period and all claims and defenses that could have been asserted in such proceedings. Buyer assumes all risk of liability, in contract or tort, for consequential
damages, property damage, and personal injury (including death) arising in any way from Buyer's transportation and storage of the Products and its containers, use
of the Products, including but not limited to using the Products in manufacturing, combining the Products with other substances, incorporating the Products in
Buyer's finished good or product, selling Buyer's finished good or product, and disposing of the Products and its containers.  Except to the extent of Seller's willful
misconduct, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, Buyer shall indemnify, defend, and hold Seller and its employees, shareholders, parents,
subsidiaries, agents and affiliates harmless from all claims, suits, demands, and actions arising out of or in connection with Buyer's sale of its own goods (including
without limitation claims for personal injury,  property damage, breach of contract, negligence, strict liability and intellectual property infringement) and all
damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and other legal expenses) arising therefrom.  This provision shall survive termination of this
Contract and delivery, use, and application of the Products.
8.  Force Majeure; Allocation. Seller shall not be liable for the delay of or failure to meet its obligations under this Contract, or the consequences to Buyer, arising
WCC Terms & Conditions Rev. 7  

               Page 3  of    4

from any event beyond Seller's control, including but not limited to: inability to obtain (on terms deemed economically and commercially practicable by Seller) raw
materials, fuel or transportation; fire, floods, inclement weather and other acts of God; strikes, lockouts or other work stoppages; wars; sabotage; accidents; plant
shut down; equipment failure; currency fluctuation or manipulation; production decisions not made by Wacker Chemical Corporation; and voluntary or involuntary
compliance with any law.  During the period of delay, and in any other times of shortage, Seller is relieved from its obligations hereunder and may allocate
available Products in a fair and reasonable manner,  as Seller determines in its sole discretion, without the obligation to obtain cover, or similar products, from other
sources.  Seller shall have the right to satisfy its own requirements and the requirements of its parent, subsidiary and affiliate companies first. Seller shall endeavor
to, but has no obligation to, provide notice of any such shortages by issuing a notice of allocation, which may include Product allotment and/or caps.
9.  Successors and Assigns.  This Contract shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective parties' successors and assigns.  Neither party may assign
this Contract without the prior written consent of the other, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
10. Governing Law; Arbitration.  The laws of the State of Tennessee will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Contract.  Any dispute or controversy
arising out of or related to this Contract, other than claims for specific performance or injunctive relief, shall be resolved by binding arbitration, in Hamilton
County, Tennessee, or such other location agreed upon by Buyer and Seller, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association in effect at the time of the demand for arbitration.  Except with respect to the foregoing , the parties agree to exclusively bring, file, and litigate  any
claims, suits, or actions arising from this Contract or related to the Products in state or federal courts of Hamilton County, Tennessee. The parties hereby disclaim
the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and expressly agree the same does not apply to the Agreement or the sale of any
Products by Seller. Unless authorized in writing by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of Seller, the sales hereunder are not subject to
federal or state contractor status, and the rules and regulations applicable thereto are not contemplated or applicable to Seller or the sale of Product(s) hereunder.
11.  Proprietary Rights; Confidentiality. All designs, drawings, specifications, samples and such other proprietary information, whether or not marked as such, made
available by Seller shall be and remain the legal property of Seller, and shall be held confidential by Buyer.  Buyer acknowledges Seller's right to injunctive relief
with respect to the foregoing.  Buyer will cease to use such proprietary information upon termination of this Contract and will promptly return to Seller any and all
such designs, drawings, specifications, and all other confidential information and data furnished.
12. Patent Infringement; WACKER Trademarks. Seller shall, at its own expense, defend and control any suit against Buyer for infringement of any United States
Letters Patent alleging the manufacture of the Products infringe any United States Letters Patent, and shall pay any award of damages assessed against Buyer in the
suit to the extent only that the damages are awarded in connection specifically with the alleged infringement;  however, the foregoing obligations shall not arise
unless Buyer gives Seller prompt notice in writing of the institution of the suit and, to the full extent of Buyer's power to do so, Buyer permits Seller to defend and
control the suit against these allegations.  If a suit or claim results in any injunction or order that would reasonably prevent Seller from supplying any Product, Seller
may, at its option: (i) secure an appropriate license to permit Seller to continue supplying those Products; (ii) modify the appropriate Product so that it becomes
non-infringing; (iii) replace the appropriate Product with a non-infringing but practically equivalent Product; or (iv) provide a refund in the amount of the purchase
price to Buyer for any Product Buyer has in inventory at the time and is prevented from using. The above fully expresses Buyer's exclusive remedy and Seller's
sole responsibility with respect to infringement or alleged infringement of any intellectual property rights by the Products, and SELLER EXPRESSLY
DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER WRITTEN OR UNWRITTEN, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WARRANTY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT with respect to the Products.
Buyer understands and agrees that all WACKER branding and product names, including those owned by Seller and/or any of its affiliates, are trademarks and
subject to protection under the law as such, even if the ® demarcation is not used. Such branding, names, and trademarks may not be used without written
permission of Seller.
13. Product Improvement; Consolidation; Cessation.  Seller may, without liability or obligation and at any time: (i) cease or discontinue the manufacture and/or sale of
any of the Products;(ii) consolidate Products with other of Seller's products; (iii) introduce new versions of any Product; and/or (iv) make iterative changes in
Product manufacture (including location, method, and raw materials). Seller shall endeavor to provide notice of any such cessation or discontinuation; however,
advance notice may not be possible, especially if such action is prompted by a governmental directive or suggestion, or if undertaken for the purpose of
safeguarding human health or safety.
14. Prohibited Parties.  Neither Buyer nor any person that directly or indirectly owns 10% or more of the outstanding equity in Buyer (collectively, the "Buyer
Persons") is, or has been determined by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury to be acting on behalf of, a Specifically Designated National and Blocked Person, or has
otherwise been designated as (i) a person or entity with whom an entity organized under the laws of the United States is prohibited from entering into transactions
or (ii) from whom such an entity is prohibited from receiving money or other property or interests in property, pursuant to Executive Orders, regulations
promulgated by the United States Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"), or otherwise. In addition, no Buyer Person is located in, or
operating from, a country subject to U.S. economic sanctions administered by OFAC. Should Buyer be found in violation of any of the aforementioned obligations,
Seller may immediately suspend sales and shipments to any and all Buyer facilities and terminate this Agreement without liability and Buyer will indemnify Seller
for all costs and liabilities arising from such violation.

General Terms and Conditions of Sale
1.  Scope of General Terms and Conditions.  These General Terms and Conditions govern all purchase orders and other contracts (individually and collectively, this
"Contract") in which buyer ("Buyer") purchases or accepts goods or products (individually, a "Product" and collectively, the "Products") from Wacker Chemical
Corporation ("Seller"). All other terms of purchase or sale in any purchase order, order confirmation, invoice or other Buyer document are rejected unless expressly
accepted in writing signed by at least two (2) of Seller's authorized signatories.
2.  Payments, Costs, Credit, Quantities, Orders and Disputed Amounts.  Any pricing offered, whether contained herein or in Seller's quotes, order confirmations, or
other documents, is not considered a 'firm offer' under any local, state, or federal law, code, regulation, rule, or statute. Buyer shall pay for each shipment of
Products whether or not Buyer has any claims or defenses arising out of other shipments.  Seller's agreement to ship without payment is an extension of credit that
is a financial accommodation to Buyer and may be stopped or changed at any time at Seller's sole discretion.  Buyer shall reimburse Seller for all taxes, as well as
any additional costs arising from customs, duties, tariffs,  and other governmental charges that are required to be paid on or that are measured by the sale,
production, transportation, or use of any Products. All orders by Buyer shall be in writing via separate purchase orders.  Upon receipt of orders, Seller issues
acknowledgement of receipt.  All orders are subject to Seller's acceptance via an order confirmation containing estimated delivery dates.  Unless otherwise agreed
to in writing by Seller, prices for all orders are contained in Seller's order confirmation.  Orders, once confirmed, cannot be canceled or modified without Seller's
written approval.  Should Seller so agree, change fees may apply.  Seller shall have no obligation to sell and deliver, and Buyer shall have no obligation to purchase,
minimum quantities or volume of Products, except as expressly agreed upon in writing signed by at least two (2) of Seller's authorized signatories. Notwithstanding
any language to the contrary contained in the Contract, if a delivery pursuant to an order confirmation occurs at a time when set pricing is not in effect (e.g. after the
expiration of an agreed upon or initial price period, if any), the parties shall negotiate updated pricing in good faith. Such previously agreed upon pricing shall not
be binding upon Seller if delivery is to occur after the expiration of any previously agreed upon pricing, if any. Buyer shall have no right of "set-off" or withholding
against properly payable invoices issued by Seller or any business affiliated with Seller.  Payment of the purchase price shall be due at the remittance address shown
on the Seller's invoice 30 days following the date of Seller's invoice unless otherwise agreed in writing. Seller may charge interest at a rate of 1 percent per month
on all balances outstanding past the due date.  Buyer shall pay all of Seller's reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable collection agency and attorneys'
fees) to enforce and preserve Seller's rights hereunder.
3.  Defaults.  Buyer will be in default of this Contract if any of the following have occurred: (1) a proceeding under 11 U.S.C. or any other federal or state insolvency
law is started by or against Buyer; (2) Buyer fails to pay for any one or more shipments within the time specified; (3) if, in Seller's estimation, Buyer appears to be
insolvent and/or generally unable to pay its debts when due and Buyer cannot provide adequate assurance of future performance; or (4) Buyer is otherwise in breach
of this Contract. If Buyer defaults, Seller may: (a) stop extending credit, change credit terms or place Buyer on "C.I.A."; (b) suspend further shipments until any
defaults have been cured and Seller has received assurances of future performance satisfactory to Seller; (c) suspend performance; (d) terminate this Contract;
and/or (e) pursue any other right or remedy available at law or in equity. Buyer's default under this or any other agreement between Buyer and Seller shall be
deemed a default under all agreements between Buyer and Seller until such default is cured. Each of the rights and remedies reserved to Seller in this paragraph
shall be cumulative, and Seller's assertion of any right or remedy shall not preclude Seller's assertion of any other rights or remedies.
4.  Shipping; Risk of Loss. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, all Products will be shipped FCA (Incoterms® 2020) from Seller's location. Risk of loss shall pass to
Buyer in accordance with the applicable Incoterm.  Seller shall retain a security interest in the Products until Seller's receipt of payment in full from Buyer.  Any
delivery dates or lead times provided by Seller are estimates only and subject to change without notification.
5.  Suitability of Products Inspection. Determination of the suitability of the Products purchased by Buyer for the use(s) contemplated by Buyer or Buyer's customers
is the sole responsibility of Buyer.  Seller's personnel may advise and/or provide information on the use and/or application of Products; however, any such
information is provided solely for informational purposes and must be assessed and vetted by Buyer.  Seller is a raw material supplier only, and as such, does not
offer consulting or professional services. Products sold to Buyer are for Buyer's internal use only and shall not be resold unless authorized in writing by an
authorized signatory of Seller. In order to mitigate or reduce damages, Buyer is responsible for ensuring all Products received conform to the Contract.  Buyer shall
promptly, and in any event prior to use and/or comingling, inspect Products for any damage to packaging, shortage, or non-conformance to this Contract.  All
claims for damage to packaging, shortage, or non-conformance which could reasonably be discovered in the course of such investigation shall be waived unless
Buyer notifies Seller, in writing, within thirty (30) days following the date of delivery, describing the non-conformity with reasonable specificity.  Failure to
promptly inspect the Products and to notify Seller in writing of non-conforming Products constitutes a waiver of all claims and actions related to the
non-conformity. Buyer shall do all that is necessary or desirable to preserve nonconforming Products for inspection and testing, to avoid incurring damage for any
nonconforming Products, to cooperate with Seller in implementing the remedies under this Contract, and to protect nonconforming Products until Seller has agreed
to the disposition or care of the nonconforming Products.
6.  Compliance with Laws. Buyer agrees to comply with all rules, regulations, ordinances and laws including those relating to Buyer's use of the Products and shall
reimburse Seller for any costs incurred due to Buyer's failure to so comply.
7.  Warranties; Buyer's Remedy; Seller's Liability Limitation.   Buyer is responsible for ensuring that the Products and specifications are adequate for Buyer's needs.
Any Products specification changes shall not bind Seller unless agreed in writing, as evidenced by a document signed by at least two (2) of Seller's authorized
signatories.Seller warrants that the specifications of the Products will be, at delivery, within the upper and lower limits of those technical data fields
reflected on the Certificate of Analysis and/or Inspection Certificate, as applicable, which accompanies the shipment of such Products.  SELLER
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY SERVICES
WARRANTIES OR WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 
Buyer's exclusive remedy, and Seller's sole liability, for non-conforming Products or breach of warranty shall be, at Seller's option, replacement of the
non-conforming Products at Buyer's original point of delivery or refund of the purchase price. Notwithstanding any language herein to the contrary, Buyer's
exclusive remedy and Seller's aggregate liability for any and all suit(s), claim(s) or action(s) against Seller arising out of this Contract, including but not limited to
those related to delivery or non-delivery of product or in tort, is expressly limited to the price for the quantity of the Products causing the occurrence from which
Buyer claims its damages were caused; and Seller's total liability under this Contract for all claims, suits, and actions, whether based in contract, tort, or any other
legal theory or otherwise, shall not exceed $100,000.  IN NO EVENT WILL SELLER BE LIABLE  FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS CONTRACT, WHETHER BASED IN TORT,
CONTRACT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, LOSS OF
SALES, LOSS OF USE, PRODUCTION DELAYS, OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, AND WHETHER OR NOT EITHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. All legal proceedings by Buyer relating to the Products must be brought within one (1) year following the date of its
shipment or, with respect to legal proceedings related to non-delivery, the requested delivery date, and Buyer waives all legal proceedings not brought within such
period and all claims and defenses that could have been asserted in such proceedings. Buyer assumes all risk of liability, in contract or tort, for consequential
damages, property damage, and personal injury (including death) arising in any way from Buyer's transportation and storage of the Products and its containers, use
of the Products, including but not limited to using the Products in manufacturing, combining the Products with other substances, incorporating the Products in
Buyer's finished good or product, selling Buyer's finished good or product, and disposing of the Products and its containers.  Except to the extent of Seller's willful
misconduct, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, Buyer shall indemnify, defend, and hold Seller and its employees, shareholders, parents,
subsidiaries, agents and affiliates harmless from all claims, suits, demands, and actions arising out of or in connection with Buyer's sale of its own goods (including
without limitation claims for personal injury,  property damage, breach of contract, negligence, strict liability and intellectual property infringement) and all
damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and other legal expenses) arising therefrom.  This provision shall survive termination of this
Contract and delivery, use, and application of the Products.
8.  Force Majeure; Allocation. Seller shall not be liable for the delay of or failure to meet its obligations under this Contract, or the consequences to Buyer, arising
WCC Terms & Conditions Rev. 7  

               Page 3  of    4

from any event beyond Seller's control, including but not limited to: inability to obtain (on terms deemed economically and commercially practicable by Seller) raw
materials, fuel or transportation; fire, floods, inclement weather and other acts of God; strikes, lockouts or other work stoppages; wars; sabotage; accidents; plant
shut down; equipment failure; currency fluctuation or manipulation; production decisions not made by Wacker Chemical Corporation; and voluntary or involuntary
compliance with any law.  During the period of delay, and in any other times of shortage, Seller is relieved from its obligations hereunder and may allocate
available Products in a fair and reasonable manner,  as Seller determines in its sole discretion, without the obligation to obtain cover, or similar products, from other
sources.  Seller shall have the right to satisfy its own requirements and the requirements of its parent, subsidiary and affiliate companies first. Seller shall endeavor
to, but has no obligation to, provide notice of any such shortages by issuing a notice of allocation, which may include Product allotment and/or caps.
9.  Successors and Assigns.  This Contract shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective parties' successors and assigns.  Neither party may assign
this Contract without the prior written consent of the other, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
10. Governing Law; Arbitration.  The laws of the State of Tennessee will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Contract.  Any dispute or controversy
arising out of or related to this Contract, other than claims for specific performance or injunctive relief, shall be resolved by binding arbitration, in Hamilton
County, Tennessee, or such other location agreed upon by Buyer and Seller, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association in effect at the time of the demand for arbitration.  Except with respect to the foregoing , the parties agree to exclusively bring, file, and litigate  any
claims, suits, or actions arising from this Contract or related to the Products in state or federal courts of Hamilton County, Tennessee. The parties hereby disclaim
the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and expressly agree the same does not apply to the Agreement or the sale of any
Products by Seller. Unless authorized in writing by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of Seller, the sales hereunder are not subject to
federal or state contractor status, and the rules and regulations applicable thereto are not contemplated or applicable to Seller or the sale of Product(s) hereunder.
11.  Proprietary Rights; Confidentiality. All designs, drawings, specifications, samples and such other proprietary information, whether or not marked as such, made
available by Seller shall be and remain the legal property of Seller, and shall be held confidential by Buyer.  Buyer acknowledges Seller's right to injunctive relief
with respect to the foregoing.  Buyer will cease to use such proprietary information upon termination of this Contract and will promptly return to Seller any and all
such designs, drawings, specifications, and all other confidential information and data furnished.
12. Patent Infringement; WACKER Trademarks. Seller shall, at its own expense, defend and control any suit against Buyer for infringement of any United States
Letters Patent alleging the manufacture of the Products infringe any United States Letters Patent, and shall pay any award of damages assessed against Buyer in the
suit to the extent only that the damages are awarded in connection specifically with the alleged infringement;  however, the foregoing obligations shall not arise
unless Buyer gives Seller prompt notice in writing of the institution of the suit and, to the full extent of Buyer's power to do so, Buyer permits Seller to defend and
control the suit against these allegations.  If a suit or claim results in any injunction or order that would reasonably prevent Seller from supplying any Product, Seller
may, at its option: (i) secure an appropriate license to permit Seller to continue supplying those Products; (ii) modify the appropriate Product so that it becomes
non-infringing; (iii) replace the appropriate Product with a non-infringing but practically equivalent Product; or (iv) provide a refund in the amount of the purchase
price to Buyer for any Product Buyer has in inventory at the time and is prevented from using. The above fully expresses Buyer's exclusive remedy and Seller's
sole responsibility with respect to infringement or alleged infringement of any intellectual property rights by the Products, and SELLER EXPRESSLY
DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER WRITTEN OR UNWRITTEN, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WARRANTY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT with respect to the Products.
Buyer understands and agrees that all WACKER branding and product names, including those owned by Seller and/or any of its affiliates, are trademarks and
subject to protection under the law as such, even if the ® demarcation is not used. Such branding, names, and trademarks may not be used without written
permission of Seller.
13. Product Improvement; Consolidation; Cessation.  Seller may, without liability or obligation and at any time: (i) cease or discontinue the manufacture and/or sale of
any of the Products;(ii) consolidate Products with other of Seller's products; (iii) introduce new versions of any Product; and/or (iv) make iterative changes in
Product manufacture (including location, method, and raw materials). Seller shall endeavor to provide notice of any such cessation or discontinuation; however,
advance notice may not be possible, especially if such action is prompted by a governmental directive or suggestion, or if undertaken for the purpose of
safeguarding human health or safety.
14. Prohibited Parties.  Neither Buyer nor any person that directly or indirectly owns 10% or more of the outstanding equity in Buyer (collectively, the "Buyer
Persons") is, or has been determined by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury to be acting on behalf of, a Specifically Designated National and Blocked Person, or has
otherwise been designated as (i) a person or entity with whom an entity organized under the laws of the United States is prohibited from entering into transactions
or (ii) from whom such an entity is prohibited from receiving money or other property or interests in property, pursuant to Executive Orders, regulations
promulgated by the United States Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"), or otherwise. In addition, no Buyer Person is located in, or
operating from, a country subject to U.S. economic sanctions administered by OFAC. Should Buyer be found in violation of any of the aforementioned obligations,
Seller may immediately suspend sales and shipments to any and all Buyer facilities and terminate this Agreement without liability and Buyer will indemnify Seller
for all costs and liabilities arising from such violation.

General Terms and Conditions of Sale
1.  Scope of General Terms and Conditions.  These General Terms and Conditions govern all purchase orders and other contracts (individually and collectively, this
"Contract") in which buyer ("Buyer") purchases or accepts goods or products (individually, a "Product" and collectively, the "Products") from Wacker Chemical
Corporation ("Seller"). All other terms of purchase or sale in any purchase order, order confirmation, invoice or other Buyer document are rejected unless expressly
accepted in writing signed by at least two (2) of Seller's authorized signatories.
2.  Payments, Costs, Credit, Quantities, Orders and Disputed Amounts.  Any pricing offered, whether contained herein or in Seller's quotes, order confirmations, or
other documents, is not considered a 'firm offer' under any local, state, or federal law, code, regulation, rule, or statute. Buyer shall pay for each shipment of
Products whether or not Buyer has any claims or defenses arising out of other shipments.  Seller's agreement to ship without payment is an extension of credit that
is a financial accommodation to Buyer and may be stopped or changed at any time at Seller's sole discretion.  Buyer shall reimburse Seller for all taxes, as well as
any additional costs arising from customs, duties, tariffs,  and other governmental charges that are required to be paid on or that are measured by the sale,
production, transportation, or use of any Products. All orders by Buyer shall be in writing via separate purchase orders.  Upon receipt of orders, Seller issues
acknowledgement of receipt.  All orders are subject to Seller's acceptance via an order confirmation containing estimated delivery dates.  Unless otherwise agreed
to in writing by Seller, prices for all orders are contained in Seller's order confirmation.  Orders, once confirmed, cannot be canceled or modified without Seller's

any language to the contrary contained in the Contract, if a delivery pursuant to an order confirmation occurs at a time when set pricing is not in effect (e.g. after the
expiration of an agreed upon or initial price period, if any), the parties shall negotiate updated pricing in good faith. Such previously agreed upon pricing shall not
be binding upon Seller if delivery is to occur after the expiration of any previously agreed upon pricing, if any. Buyer shall have no right of "set-off" or withholding
against properly payable invoices issued by Seller or any business affiliated with Seller.  Payment of the purchase price shall be due at the remittance address shown

on all balances outstanding past the due date.  Buyer shall pay all of Seller's reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable collection agency and attorneys'
fees) to enforce and preserve Seller's rights hereunder.
3.  Defaults.  Buyer will be in default of this Contract if any of the following have occurred: (1) a proceeding under 11 U.S.C. or any other federal or state insolvency
law is started by or against Buyer; (2) Buyer fails to pay for any one or more shipments within the time specified; (3) if, in Seller's estimation, Buyer appears to be
insolvent and/or generally unable to pay its debts when due and Buyer cannot provide adequate assurance of future performance; or (4) Buyer is otherwise in breach
of this Contract. If Buyer defaults, Seller may: (a) stop extending credit, change credit terms or place Buyer on "C.I.A."; (b) suspend further shipments until any
defaults have been cured and Seller has received assurances of future performance satisfactory to Seller; (c) suspend performance; (d) terminate this Contract;
and/or (e) pursue any other right or remedy available at law or in equity. Buyer's default under this or any other agreement between Buyer and Seller shall be
deemed a default under all agreements between Buyer and Seller until such default is cured. Each of the rights and remedies reserved to Seller in this paragraph
shall be cumulative, and Seller's assertion of any right or remedy shall not preclude Seller's assertion of any other rights or remedies.
4.  Shipping; Risk of Loss. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, all Products will be shipped FCA (Incoterms® 2020) from Seller's location. Risk of loss shall pass to
Buyer in accordance with the applicable Incoterm.  Seller shall retain a security interest in the Products until Seller's receipt of payment in full from Buyer.  Any
delivery dates or lead times provided by Seller are estimates only and subject to change without notification.
5.  Suitability of Products Inspection. Determination of the suitability of the Products purchased by Buyer for the use(s) contemplated by Buyer or Buyer's customers
is the sole responsibility of Buyer.  Seller's personnel may advise and/or provide information on the use and/or application of Products; however, any such
information is provided solely for informational purposes and must be assessed and vetted by Buyer.  Seller is a raw material supplier only, and as such, does not
offer consulting or professional services. Products sold to Buyer are for Buyer's internal use only and shall not be resold unless authorized in writing by an
authorized signatory of Seller. In order to mitigate or reduce damages, Buyer is responsible for ensuring all Products received conform to the Contract.  Buyer shall
promptly, and in any event prior to use and/or comingling, inspect Products for any damage to packaging, shortage, or non-conformance to this Contract.  All
claims for damage to packaging, shortage, or non-conformance which could reasonably be discovered in the course of such investigation shall be waived unless
Buyer notifies Seller, in writing, within thirty (30) days following the date of delivery, describing the non-conformity with reasonable specificity.  Failure to
promptly inspect the Products and to notify Seller in writing of non-conforming Products constitutes a waiver of all claims and actions related to the
non-conformity. Buyer shall do all that is necessary or desirable to preserve nonconforming Products for inspection and testing, to avoid incurring damage for any
nonconforming Products, to cooperate with Seller in implementing the remedies under this Contract, and to protect nonconforming Products until Seller has agreed
to the disposition or care of the nonconforming Products.
6.  Compliance with Laws. Buyer agrees to comply with all rules, regulations, ordinances and laws including those relating to Buyer's use of the Products and shall
reimburse Seller for any costs incurred due to Buyer's failure to so comply.
7.  Warranties; Buyer's Remedy; Seller's Liability Limitation.   Buyer is responsible for ensuring that the Products and specifications are adequate for Buyer's needs.
Any Products specification changes shall not bind Seller unless agreed in writing, as evidenced by a document signed by at least two (2) of Seller's authorized
signatories.Seller warrants that the specifications of the Products will be, at delivery, within the upper and lower limits of those technical data fields
reflected on the Certificate of Analysis and/or Inspection Certificate, as applicable, which accompanies the shipment of such Products.  SELLER
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY SERVICES
WARRANTIES OR WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 
Buyer's exclusive remedy, and Seller's sole liability, for non-conforming Products or breach of warranty shall be, at Seller's option, replacement of the
non-conforming Products at Buyer's original point of delivery or refund of the purchase price. Notwithstanding any language herein to the contrary, Buyer's
exclusive remedy and Seller's aggregate liability for any and all suit(s), claim(s) or action(s) against Seller arising out of this Contract, including but not limited to
those related to delivery or non-delivery of product or in tort, is expressly limited to the price for the quantity of the Products causing the occurrence from which
Buyer claims its damages were caused; and Seller's total liability under this Contract for all claims, suits, and actions, whether based in contract, tort, or any other
legal theory or otherwise, shall not exceed $100,000.  IN NO EVENT WILL SELLER BE LIABLE  FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS CONTRACT, WHETHER BASED IN TORT,
CONTRACT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, LOSS OF
SALES, LOSS OF USE, PRODUCTION DELAYS, OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, AND WHETHER OR NOT EITHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. All legal proceedings by Buyer relating to the Products must be brought within one (1) year following the date of its
shipment or, with respect to legal proceedings related to non-delivery, the requested delivery date, and Buyer waives all legal proceedings not brought within such
period and all claims and defenses that could have been asserted in such proceedings. Buyer assumes all risk of liability, in contract or tort, for consequential
damages, property damage, and personal injury (including death) arising in any way from Buyer's transportation and storage of the Products and its containers, use
of the Products, including but not limited to using the Products in manufacturing, combining the Products with other substances, incorporating the Products in
Buyer's finished good or product, selling Buyer's finished good or product, and disposing of the Products and its containers.  Except to the extent of Seller's willful
misconduct, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, Buyer shall indemnify, defend, and hold Seller and its employees, shareholders, parents,
subsidiaries, agents and affiliates harmless from all claims, suits, demands, and actions arising out of or in connection with Buyer's sale of its own goods (including
without limitation claims for personal injury,  property damage, breach of contract, negligence, strict liability and intellectual property infringement) and all
damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and other legal expenses) arising therefrom.  This provision shall survive termination of this
Contract and delivery, use, and application of the Products.
8.  Force Majeure; Allocation. Seller shall not be liable for the delay of or failure to meet its obligations under this Contract, or the consequences to Buyer, arising
WCC Terms & Conditions Rev. 7  

               Page 3  of    4

from any event beyond Seller's control, including but not limited to: inability to obtain (on terms deemed economically and commercially practicable by Seller) raw
materials, fuel or transportation; fire, floods, inclement weather and other acts of God; strikes, lockouts or other work stoppages; wars; sabotage; accidents; plant
shut down; equipment failure; currency fluctuation or manipulation; production decisions not made by Wacker Chemical Corporation; and voluntary or involuntary
compliance with any law.  During the period of delay, and in any other times of shortage, Seller is relieved from its obligations hereunder and may allocate
available Products in a fair and reasonable manner,  as Seller determines in its sole discretion, without the obligation to obtain cover, or similar products, from other
sources.  Seller shall have the right to satisfy its own requirements and the requirements of its parent, subsidiary and affiliate companies first. Seller shall endeavor
to, but has no obligation to, provide notice of any such shortages by issuing a notice of allocation, which may include Product allotment and/or caps.
9.  Successors and Assigns.  This Contract shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective parties' successors and assigns.  Neither party may assign
this Contract without the prior written consent of the other, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
10. Governing Law; Arbitration.  The laws of the State of Tennessee will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Contract.  Any dispute or controversy
arising out of or related to this Contract, other than claims for specific performance or injunctive relief, shall be resolved by binding arbitration, in Hamilton
County, Tennessee, or such other location agreed upon by Buyer and Seller, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association in effect at the time of the demand for arbitration.  Except with respect to the foregoing , the parties agree to exclusively bring, file, and litigate  any
claims, suits, or actions arising from this Contract or related to the Products in state or federal courts of Hamilton County, Tennessee. The parties hereby disclaim
the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and expressly agree the same does not apply to the Agreement or the sale of any
Products by Seller. Unless authorized in writing by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of Seller, the sales hereunder are not subject to
federal or state contractor status, and the rules and regulations applicable thereto are not contemplated or applicable to Seller or the sale of Product(s) hereunder.
11.  Proprietary Rights; Confidentiality. All designs, drawings, specifications, samples and such other proprietary information, whether or not marked as such, made
available by Seller shall be and remain the legal property of Seller, and shall be held confidential by Buyer.  Buyer acknowledges Seller's right to injunctive relief
with respect to the foregoing.  Buyer will cease to use such proprietary information upon termination of this Contract and will promptly return to Seller any and all
such designs, drawings, specifications, and all other confidential information and data furnished.
12. Patent Infringement; WACKER Trademarks. Seller shall, at its own expense, defend and control any suit against Buyer for infringement of any United States
Letters Patent alleging the manufacture of the Products infringe any United States Letters Patent, and shall pay any award of damages assessed against Buyer in the
suit to the extent only that the damages are awarded in connection specifically with the alleged infringement;  however, the foregoing obligations shall not arise
unless Buyer gives Seller prompt notice in writing of the institution of the suit and, to the full extent of Buyer's power to do so, Buyer permits Seller to defend and
control the suit against these allegations.  If a suit or claim results in any injunction or order that would reasonably prevent Seller from supplying any Product, Seller
may, at its option: (i) secure an appropriate license to permit Seller to continue supplying those Products; (ii) modify the appropriate Product so that it becomes
non-infringing; (iii) replace the appropriate Product with a non-infringing but practically equivalent Product; or (iv) provide a refund in the amount of the purchase
price to Buyer for any Product Buyer has in inventory at the time and is prevented from using. The above fully expresses Buyer's exclusive remedy and Seller's
sole responsibility with respect to infringement or alleged infringement of any intellectual property rights by the Products, and SELLER EXPRESSLY
DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER WRITTEN OR UNWRITTEN, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WARRANTY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT with respect to the Products.
Buyer understands and agrees that all WACKER branding and product names, including those owned by Seller and/or any of its affiliates, are trademarks and
subject to protection under the law as such, even if the ® demarcation is not used. Such branding, names, and trademarks may not be used without written
permission of Seller.
13. Product Improvement; Consolidation; Cessation.  Seller may, without liability or obligation and at any time: (i) cease or discontinue the manufacture and/or sale of
any of the Products;(ii) consolidate Products with other of Seller's products; (iii) introduce new versions of any Product; and/or (iv) make iterative changes in
Product manufacture (including location, method, and raw materials). Seller shall endeavor to provide notice of any such cessation or discontinuation; however,
advance notice may not be possible, especially if such action is prompted by a governmental directive or suggestion, or if undertaken for the purpose of
safeguarding human health or safety.
14. Prohibited Parties.  Neither Buyer nor any person that directly or indirectly owns 10% or more of the outstanding equity in Buyer (collectively, the "Buyer
Persons") is, or has been determined by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury to be acting on behalf of, a Specifically Designated National and Blocked Person, or has
otherwise been designated as (i) a person or entity with whom an entity organized under the laws of the United States is prohibited from entering into transactions
or (ii) from whom such an entity is prohibited from receiving money or other property or interests in property, pursuant to Executive Orders, regulations
promulgated by the United States Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"), or otherwise. In addition, no Buyer Person is located in, or
operating from, a country subject to U.S. economic sanctions administered by OFAC. Should Buyer be found in violation of any of the aforementioned obligations,
Seller may immediately suspend sales and shipments to any and all Buyer facilities and terminate this Agreement without liability and Buyer will indemnify Seller
for all costs and liabilities arising from such violation.

General Terms and Conditions of Sale

1.Scope of General Terms and Conditions. These General Terms and Conditions govern all purchase orders and other contracts (individually and collectively, this 
"Contract") in which buyer ("Buyer") purchases or accepts goods or products (individually, a "Product" and collectively, the "Products") from Wacker Chemical 
Corporation ("Seller"). All other terms of purchase or sale in any purchase order, order confirmation, invoice or other Buyer document are rejected unless expressly 
accepted in writing signed by at least two (2) of Seller' s authorized signatories.
2.Payments, Costs, Credit, Quantities, Orders and Disputed Amounts.  Any pricing offered, whether contained herein or in Seller' s quotes, order confirmations, or    other 
documents, is not considered a ' firm offer'  under any local, state, or federal law, code, regulation, rule, or statute. Buyer shall pay for each shipment of  Products
whether or not Buyer has any claims or defenses arising out of other shipments.  Seller' s agreement to ship without payment is an extension of credit that   is a 
financial accommodation to Buyer and may be stopped or changed at any time at Seller' s sole discretion.  Buyer shall reimburse Seller for all taxes, as well as  any 
additional costs arising from customs, duties, tariffs, and other governmental charges that are required to be paid on or that are measured by the sale,  production, 
transportation, or use of any Products. All orders by Buyer shall be in writing via separate purchase orders. Upon receipt of orders, Seller issues  acknowledgement of 
receipt.  All orders are subject to Seller' s acceptance via an order confirmation containing estimated delivery dates.  Unless otherwise agreed   to in writing by Seller,
prices for all orders are contained in Seller' s order confirmation.  Orders, once confirmed, cannot be canceled or modified without Seller' s  written approval. Should 
Seller so agree, change fees may apply. Seller shall have no obligation to sell and deliver, and Buyer shall have no obligation to purchase,  minimum quantities or 
volume of Products, except as expressly agreed upon in writing signed by at least two (2) of Seller' s authorized signatories. Notwithstanding  any language to the 
contrary contained in the Contract, if a delivery pursuant to an order confirmation occurs at a time when set pricing is not in effect (e.g. after the expiration of an
agreed upon or initial price period, if any), the parties shall negotiate updated pricing in good faith. Such previously agreed upon pricing shall not  be binding upon 
Seller if delivery is to occur after the expiration of any previously agreed upon pricing, if any. Buyer shall have no right of "set-off" or withholding  against properly 
payable invoices issued by Seller or any business affiliated with Seller. Payment of the purchase price shall be due at the remittance address shown  on the Seller' s
invoice 30 days following the date of Seller' s invoice unless otherwise agreed in writing. Seller may charge interest at a rate of 1 percent per month  on all balances 
outstanding past the due date.  Buyer shall pay all of Seller' s reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable collection agency and attorneys'  fees) to enforce 
and preserve Seller' s rights hereunder.
3.Defaults. Buyer will be in default of this Contract if any of the following have occurred: (1) a proceeding under 11 U.S.C. or any other federal or state insolvency 
law is started by or against Buyer; (2) Buyer fails to pay for any one or more shipments within the time specified; (3) if, in Seller' s estimation, Buyer appears to be  
insolvent and/or generally unable to pay its debts when due and Buyer cannot provide adequate assurance of future performance; or (4) Buyer is otherwise in breach 
of this Contract. If Buyer defaults, Seller may: (a) stop extending credit, change credit terms or place Buyer on "C.I.A."; (b) suspend further shipments until any 
defaults have been cured and Seller has received assurances of future performance satisfactory to Seller; (c) suspend performance; (d) terminate this Contract; 
and/or (e) pursue any other right or remedy available at law or in equity. Buyer' s default under this or any other agreement between Buyer and Seller shall be  
deemed a default under all agreements between Buyer and Seller until such default is cured. Each of the rights and remedies reserved to Seller in this paragraph 
shall be cumulative, and Seller' s assertion of any right or remedy shall not preclude Seller' s assertion of any other rights or remedies.
4.Shipping; Risk of Loss. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, all Products will be shipped FCA (Incoterms® 2020) from Seller' s location. Risk of loss shall pass to  
Buyer in accordance with the applicable Incoterm.  Seller shall retain a security interest in the Products until Seller' s receipt of payment in full from Buyer.  Any  
delivery dates or lead times provided by Seller are estimates only and subject to change without notification.
5.Suitability of Products Inspection. Determination of the suitability of the Products purchased by Buyer for the use(s) contemplated by Buyer or Buyer' s customers  is 
the sole responsibility of Buyer.  Seller' s personnel may advise and/or provide information on the use and/or application of Products; however, any such  
information is provided solely for informational purposes and must be assessed and vetted by Buyer. Seller is a raw material supplier only, and as such, does not 
offer consulting or professional services. Products sold to Buyer are for Buyer' s internal use only and shall not be resold unless authorized in writing by an  
authorized signatory of Seller. In order to mitigate or reduce damages, Buyer is responsible for ensuring all Products received conform to the Contract. Buyer shall 
promptly, and in any event prior to use and/or comingling, inspect Products for any damage to packaging, shortage, or non-conformance to this Contract. All 
claims for damage to packaging, shortage, or non-conformance which could reasonably be discovered in the course of such investigation shall be waived unless 
Buyer notifies Seller, in writing, within thirty (30) days following the date of delivery, describing the non-conformity with reasonable specificity. Failure to 
promptly inspect the Products and to notify Seller in writing of non-conforming Products constitutes a waiver of all claims and actions related to the
non-conformity. Buyer shall do all that is necessary or desirable to preserve nonconforming Products for inspection and testing, to avoid incurring damage for any
nonconforming Products, to cooperate with Seller in implementing the remedies under this Contract, and to protect nonconforming Products until Seller has agreed
to the disposition or care of the nonconforming Products.
6.Compliance with Laws. Buyer agrees to comply with all rules, regulations, ordinances and laws including those relating to Buyer' s use of the Products and shall
reimburse Seller for any costs incurred due to Buyer' s failure to so comply.
7.  Warranties; Buyer's Remedy; Seller's Liability Limitation. Buyer is responsible for ensuring that the Products and specifications are adequate for Buyer' s needs.
Any Products specification changes shall not bind Seller unless agreed in writing, as evidenced by a document signed by at least two (2) of Seller' s authorized  
signatories.Seller warrants that the specifications of the Products will be, at delivery, within the upper and lower limits of those technical data fields 
reflected on the Certificate of Analysis and/or Inspection Certificate, as applicable, which accompanies the shipment of such Products. SELLER 
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY SERVICES 
WARRANTIES OR WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
Buyer' s exclusive remedy, and Seller' s sole liability, for non-conforming Products or breach of warranty shall be, at Seller' s option, replacement of the
non-conforming Products at Buyer' s original point of delivery or refund of the purchase price. Notwithstanding any language herein to the contrary, Buyer' s  
exclusive remedy and Seller' s aggregate liability for any and all suit(s), claim(s) or action(s) against Seller arising out of this Contract, including but not limited to  
those related to delivery or non-delivery of product or in tort, is expressly limited to the price for the quantity of the Products causing the occurrence from which 
Buyer claims its damages were caused; and Seller' s total liability under this Contract for all claims, suits, and actions, whether based in contract, tort, or any other  
legal theory or otherwise, shall not exceed $100,000. IN NO EVENT WILL SELLER BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, 
CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS CONTRACT, WHETHER BASED IN TORT, 
CONTRACT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, LOSS OF 
SALES, LOSS OF USE, PRODUCTION DELAYS, OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, AND WHETHER OR NOT EITHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. All legal proceedings by Buyer relating to the Products must be brought within one (1) year following the date of its 
shipment or, with respect to legal proceedings related to non-delivery, the requested delivery date, and Buyer waives all legal proceedings not brought within such 
period and all claims and defenses that could have been asserted in such proceedings. Buyer assumes all risk of liability, in contract or tort, for consequential 
damages, property damage, and personal injury (including death) arising in any way from Buyer' s transportation and storage of the Products and its containers, use  
of the Products, including but not limited to using the Products in manufacturing, combining the Products with other substances, incorporating the Products in 
Buyer' s finished good or product, selling Buyer' s finished good or product, and disposing of the Products and its containers.  Except to the extent of Seller' s willful  
misconduct, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, Buyer shall indemnify, defend, and hold Seller and its employees, shareholders, parents, 
subsidiaries, agents and affiliates harmless from all claims, suits, demands, and actions arising out of or in connection with Buyer' s sale of its own goods (including  
without limitation claims for personal injury, property damage, breach of contract, negligence, strict liability and intellectual property infringement) and all 
damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney' s fees and other legal expenses) arising therefrom.  This provision shall survive termination of this  
Contract and delivery, use, and application of the Products.
8. Force Majeure; Allocation. Seller shall not be liable for the delay of or failure to meet its obligations under this Contract, or the consequences to Buyer, arising

materials, fuel or transportation; fire, floods, inclement weather and other acts of God; strikes, lockouts or other work stoppages; wars; sabotage; accidents; plant 
shut down; equipment failure; currency fluctuation or manipulation; production decisions not made by Wacker Chemical Corporation; and voluntary or involuntary 
compliance with any law. During the period of delay, and in any other times of shortage, Seller is relieved from its obligations hereunder and may allocate 
available Products in a fair and reasonable manner, as Seller determines in its sole discretion, without the obligation to obtain cover, or similar products, from other 
sources. Seller shall have the right to satisfy its own requirements and the requirements of its parent, subsidiary and affiliate companies first. Seller shall endeavor 
to, but has no obligation to, provide notice of any such shortages by issuing a notice of allocation, which may include Product allotment and/or caps.
9.Successors and Assigns. This Contract shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective parties' successors and assigns. Neither party may assign 
this Contract without the prior written consent of the other, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
10.Governing Law; Arbitration. The laws of the State of Tennessee will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Contract. Any dispute or controversy 
arising out of or related to this Contract, other than claims for specific performance or injunctive relief, shall be resolved by binding arbitration, in Hamilton

claims, suits, or actions arising from this Contract or related to the Products in state or federal courts of Hamilton County, Tennessee. The parties hereby disclaim 
the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and expressly agree the same does not apply to the Agreement or the sale of any 
Products by Seller. Unless authorized in writing by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of Seller, the sales hereunder are not subject to 
federal or state contractor status, and the rules and regulations applicable thereto are not contemplated or applicable to Seller or the sale of Product(s) hereunder.
11.Proprietary Rights; Confidentiality. All designs, drawings, specifications, samples and such other proprietary information, whether or not marked as such, made
available by Seller shall be and remain the legal property of Seller, and shall be held confidential by Buyer. Buyer acknowledges Seller' s right to injunctive relief

such designs, drawings, specifications, and all other confidential information and data furnished.
12.Patent Infringement; WACKER Trademarks. Seller shall, at its own expense, defend and control any suit against Buyer for infringement of any United States 
Letters Patent alleging the manufacture of the Products infringe any United States Letters Patent, and shall pay any award of damages assessed against Buyer in the 
suit to the extent only that the damages are awarded in connection specifically with the alleged infringement; however, the foregoing obligations shall not arise 
unless Buyer gives Seller prompt notice in writing of the institution of the suit and, to the full extent of Buyer' s power to do so, Buyer permits Seller to defend and  
control the suit against these allegations. If a suit or claim results in any injunction or order that would reasonably prevent Seller from supplying any Product, Seller

non-infringing; (iii) replace the appropriate Product with a non-infringing but practically equivalent Product; or (iv) provide a refund in the amount of the purchase 
price to Buyer for any Product Buyer has in inventory at the time and is prevented from using. The above fully expresses Buyer' s exclusive remedy and Seller' s  
sole responsibility with respect to infringement or alleged infringement of any intellectual property rights by the Products, and SELLER EXPRESSLY 
DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER WRITTEN OR UNWRITTEN, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WARRANTY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT with respect to the Products.
Buyer understands and agrees that all WACKER branding and product names, including those owned by Seller and/or any of its affiliates, are trademarks and 
subject to protection under the law as such, even if the ® demarcation is not used. Such branding, names, and trademarks may not be used without written 
permission of Seller.

any of the Products;(ii) consolidate Products with other of Seller' s products; (iii) introduce new versions of any Product; and/or (iv) make iterative changes in  
Product manufacture (including location, method, and raw materials). Seller shall endeavor to provide notice of any such cessation or discontinuation; however, 
advance notice may not be possible, especially if such action is prompted by a governmental directive or suggestion, or if undertaken for the purpose of 
safeguarding human health or safety.
14.Prohibited Parties. Neither Buyer nor any person that directly or indirectly owns 10% or more of the outstanding equity in Buyer (collectively, the "Buyer 
Persons") is, or has been determined by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury to be acting on behalf of, a Specifically Designated National and Blocked Person, or has

or (ii) from whom such an entity is prohibited from receiving money or other property or interests in property, pursuant to Executive Orders, regulations 
promulgated by the United States Treasury Department' s Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"), or otherwise. In addition, no Buyer Person is located in, or

General Terms and Conditions of Sale

1.Scope of General Terms and Conditions. These General Terms and Conditions govern all purchase orders and other contracts (individually and collectively, this 
"Contract") in which buyer ("Buyer") purchases or accepts goods or products (individually, a "Product" and collectively, the "Products") from Wacker Chemical 
Corporation ("Seller"). All other terms of purchase or sale in any purchase order, order confirmation, invoice or other Buyer document are rejected unless expressly 
accepted in writing signed by at least two (2) of Seller' s authorized signatories.
2.Payments, Costs, Credit, Quantities, Orders and Disputed Amounts.  Any pricing offered, whether contained herein or in Seller' s quotes, order confirmations, or    other 
documents, is not considered a ' firm offer'  under any local, state, or federal law, code, regulation, rule, or statute. Buyer shall pay for each shipment of  Products
whether or not Buyer has any claims or defenses arising out of other shipments.  Seller' s agreement to ship without payment is an extension of credit that   is a 
financial accommodation to Buyer and may be stopped or changed at any time at Seller' s sole discretion.  Buyer shall reimburse Seller for all taxes, as well as  any 
additional costs arising from customs, duties, tariffs, and other governmental charges that are required to be paid on or that are measured by the sale,  production, 
transportation, or use of any Products. All orders by Buyer shall be in writing via separate purchase orders. Upon receipt of orders, Seller issues  acknowledgement of 
receipt.  All orders are subject to Seller' s acceptance via an order confirmation containing estimated delivery dates.  Unless otherwise agreed   to in writing by Seller,
prices for all orders are contained in Seller' s order confirmation.  Orders, once confirmed, cannot be canceled or modified without Seller' s  written approval. Should 
Seller so agree, change fees may apply. Seller shall have no obligation to sell and deliver, and Buyer shall have no obligation to purchase,  minimum quantities or 
volume of Products, except as expressly agreed upon in writing signed by at least two (2) of Seller' s authorized signatories. Notwithstanding  any language to the 
contrary contained in the Contract, if a delivery pursuant to an order confirmation occurs at a time when set pricing is not in effect (e.g. after the expiration of an
agreed upon or initial price period, if any), the parties shall negotiate updated pricing in good faith. Such previously agreed upon pricing shall not  be binding upon 
Seller if delivery is to occur after the expiration of any previously agreed upon pricing, if any. Buyer shall have no right of "set-off" or withholding  against properly 
payable invoices issued by Seller or any business affiliated with Seller. Payment of the purchase price shall be due at the remittance address shown  on the Seller' s
invoice 30 days following the date of Seller' s invoice unless otherwise agreed in writing. Seller may charge interest at a rate of 1 percent per month  on all balances 
outstanding past the due date.  Buyer shall pay all of Seller' s reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable collection agency and attorneys'  fees) to enforce 
and preserve Seller' s rights hereunder.
3.Defaults. Buyer will be in default of this Contract if any of the following have occurred: (1) a proceeding under 11 U.S.C. or any other federal or state insolvency 
law is started by or against Buyer; (2) Buyer fails to pay for any one or more shipments within the time specified; (3) if, in Seller' s estimation, Buyer appears to be  
insolvent and/or generally unable to pay its debts when due and Buyer cannot provide adequate assurance of future performance; or (4) Buyer is otherwise in breach 
of this Contract. If Buyer defaults, Seller may: (a) stop extending credit, change credit terms or place Buyer on "C.I.A."; (b) suspend further shipments until any 
defaults have been cured and Seller has received assurances of future performance satisfactory to Seller; (c) suspend performance; (d) terminate this Contract; 
and/or (e) pursue any other right or remedy available at law or in equity. Buyer' s default under this or any other agreement between Buyer and Seller shall be  
deemed a default under all agreements between Buyer and Seller until such default is cured. Each of the rights and remedies reserved to Seller in this paragraph 
shall be cumulative, and Seller' s assertion of any right or remedy shall not preclude Seller' s assertion of any other rights or remedies.
4.Shipping; Risk of Loss. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, all Products will be shipped FCA (Incoterms® 2020) from Seller' s location. Risk of loss shall pass to  
Buyer in accordance with the applicable Incoterm.  Seller shall retain a security interest in the Products until Seller' s receipt of payment in full from Buyer.  Any  
delivery dates or lead times provided by Seller are estimates only and subject to change without notification.
5.Suitability of Products Inspection. Determination of the suitability of the Products purchased by Buyer for the use(s) contemplated by Buyer or Buyer' s customers  is 
the sole responsibility of Buyer.  Seller' s personnel may advise and/or provide information on the use and/or application of Products; however, any such  
information is provided solely for informational purposes and must be assessed and vetted by Buyer. Seller is a raw material supplier only, and as such, does not 
offer consulting or professional services. Products sold to Buyer are for Buyer' s internal use only and shall not be resold unless authorized in writing by an  
authorized signatory of Seller. In order to mitigate or reduce damages, Buyer is responsible for ensuring all Products received conform to the Contract. Buyer shall 
promptly, and in any event prior to use and/or comingling, inspect Products for any damage to packaging, shortage, or non-conformance to this Contract. All 
claims for damage to packaging, shortage, or non-conformance which could reasonably be discovered in the course of such investigation shall be waived unless 
Buyer notifies Seller, in writing, within thirty (30) days following the date of delivery, describing the non-conformity with reasonable specificity. Failure to 
promptly inspect the Products and to notify Seller in writing of non-conforming Products constitutes a waiver of all claims and actions related to the
non-conformity. Buyer shall do all that is necessary or desirable to preserve nonconforming Products for inspection and testing, to avoid incurring damage for any
nonconforming Products, to cooperate with Seller in implementing the remedies under this Contract, and to protect nonconforming Products until Seller has agreed
to the disposition or care of the nonconforming Products.
6.Compliance with Laws. Buyer agrees to comply with all rules, regulations, ordinances and laws including those relating to Buyer' s use of the Products and shall
reimburse Seller for any costs incurred due to Buyer' s failure to so comply.
7.  Warranties; Buyer's Remedy; Seller's Liability Limitation. Buyer is responsible for ensuring that the Products and specifications are adequate for Buyer' s needs.
Any Products specification changes shall not bind Seller unless agreed in writing, as evidenced by a document signed by at least two (2) of Seller' s authorized  
signatories.Seller warrants that the specifications of the Products will be, at delivery, within the upper and lower limits of those technical data fields 
reflected on the Certificate of Analysis and/or Inspection Certificate, as applicable, which accompanies the shipment of such Products. SELLER 
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY SERVICES 
WARRANTIES OR WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
Buyer' s exclusive remedy, and Seller' s sole liability, for non-conforming Products or breach of warranty shall be, at Seller' s option, replacement of the
non-conforming Products at Buyer' s original point of delivery or refund of the purchase price. Notwithstanding any language herein to the contrary, Buyer' s  
exclusive remedy and Seller' s aggregate liability for any and all suit(s), claim(s) or action(s) against Seller arising out of this Contract, including but not limited to  
those related to delivery or non-delivery of product or in tort, is expressly limited to the price for the quantity of the Products causing the occurrence from which 
Buyer claims its damages were caused; and Seller' s total liability under this Contract for all claims, suits, and actions, whether based in contract, tort, or any other  
legal theory or otherwise, shall not exceed $100,000. IN NO EVENT WILL SELLER BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, 
CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS CONTRACT, WHETHER BASED IN TORT, 
CONTRACT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, LOSS OF 
SALES, LOSS OF USE, PRODUCTION DELAYS, OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, AND WHETHER OR NOT EITHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. All legal proceedings by Buyer relating to the Products must be brought within one (1) year following the date of its 
shipment or, with respect to legal proceedings related to non-delivery, the requested delivery date, and Buyer waives all legal proceedings not brought within such 
period and all claims and defenses that could have been asserted in such proceedings. Buyer assumes all risk of liability, in contract or tort, for consequential 
damages, property damage, and personal injury (including death) arising in any way from Buyer' s transportation and storage of the Products and its containers, use  
of the Products, including but not limited to using the Products in manufacturing, combining the Products with other substances, incorporating the Products in 
Buyer' s finished good or product, selling Buyer' s finished good or product, and disposing of the Products and its containers.  Except to the extent of Seller' s willful  
misconduct, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, Buyer shall indemnify, defend, and hold Seller and its employees, shareholders, parents, 
subsidiaries, agents and affiliates harmless from all claims, suits, demands, and actions arising out of or in connection with Buyer' s sale of its own goods (including  
without limitation claims for personal injury, property damage, breach of contract, negligence, strict liability and intellectual property infringement) and all 
damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney' s fees and other legal expenses) arising therefrom.  This provision shall survive termination of this  
Contract and delivery, use, and application of the Products.
8. Force Majeure; Allocation. Seller shall not be liable for the delay of or failure to meet its obligations under this Contract, or the consequences to Buyer, arising

WCC Terms & Conditions Rev. 7

Page 3 of 4

from any event beyond Seller' s control, including but not limited to: inability to obtain (on terms deemed economically and commercially practicable by Seller) raw  
materials, fuel or transportation; fire, floods, inclement weather and other acts of God; strikes, lockouts or other work stoppages; wars; sabotage; accidents; plant 
shut down; equipment failure; currency fluctuation or manipulation; production decisions not made by Wacker Chemical Corporation; and voluntary or involuntary 
compliance with any law. During the period of delay, and in any other times of shortage, Seller is relieved from its obligations hereunder and may allocate 
available Products in a fair and reasonable manner, as Seller determines in its sole discretion, without the obligation to obtain cover, or similar products, from other 
sources. Seller shall have the right to satisfy its own requirements and the requirements of its parent, subsidiary and affiliate companies first. Seller shall endeavor 
to, but has no obligation to, provide notice of any such shortages by issuing a notice of allocation, which may include Product allotment and/or caps.
9.Successors and Assigns. This Contract shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective parties' successors and assigns. Neither party may assign 
this Contract without the prior written consent of the other, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
10.Governing Law; Arbitration. The laws of the State of Tennessee will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Contract. Any dispute or controversy 
arising out of or related to this Contract, other than claims for specific performance or injunctive relief, shall be resolved by binding arbitration, in Hamilton 
County, Tennessee, or such other location agreed upon by Buyer and Seller, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration 
Association in effect at the time of the demand for arbitration. Except with respect to the foregoing , the parties agree to exclusively bring, file, and litigate any 
claims, suits, or actions arising from this Contract or related to the Products in state or federal courts of Hamilton County, Tennessee. The parties hereby disclaim 
the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and expressly agree the same does not apply to the Agreement or the sale of any 
Products by Seller. Unless authorized in writing by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of Seller, the sales hereunder are not subject to 
federal or state contractor status, and the rules and regulations applicable thereto are not contemplated or applicable to Seller or the sale of Product(s) hereunder.
11.Proprietary Rights; Confidentiality. All designs, drawings, specifications, samples and such other proprietary information, whether or not marked as such, made
available by Seller shall be and remain the legal property of Seller, and shall be held confidential by Buyer. Buyer acknowledges Seller' s right to injunctive relief
with respect to the foregoing. Buyer will cease to use such proprietary information upon termination of this Contract and will promptly return to Seller any and all
such designs, drawings, specifications, and all other confidential information and data furnished.
12.Patent Infringement; WACKER Trademarks. Seller shall, at its own expense, defend and control any suit against Buyer for infringement of any United States 
Letters Patent alleging the manufacture of the Products infringe any United States Letters Patent, and shall pay any award of damages assessed against Buyer in the 
suit to the extent only that the damages are awarded in connection specifically with the alleged infringement; however, the foregoing obligations shall not arise 
unless Buyer gives Seller prompt notice in writing of the institution of the suit and, to the full extent of Buyer' s power to do so, Buyer permits Seller to defend and  
control the suit against these allegations. If a suit or claim results in any injunction or order that would reasonably prevent Seller from supplying any Product, Seller 
may, at its option: (i) secure an appropriate license to permit Seller to continue supplying those Products; (ii) modify the appropriate Product so that it becomes
non-infringing; (iii) replace the appropriate Product with a non-infringing but practically equivalent Product; or (iv) provide a refund in the amount of the purchase 
price to Buyer for any Product Buyer has in inventory at the time and is prevented from using. The above fully expresses Buyer' s exclusive remedy and Seller' s  
sole responsibility with respect to infringement or alleged infringement of any intellectual property rights by the Products, and SELLER EXPRESSLY 
DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER WRITTEN OR UNWRITTEN, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WARRANTY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT with respect to the Products.
Buyer understands and agrees that all WACKER branding and product names, including those owned by Seller and/or any of its affiliates, are trademarks and 
subject to protection under the law as such, even if the ® demarcation is not used. Such branding, names, and trademarks may not be used without written 
permission of Seller.
13.Product Improvement; Consolidation; Cessation. Seller may, without liability or obligation and at any time: (i) cease or discontinue the manufacture and/or sale of 
any of the Products;(ii) consolidate Products with other of Seller' s products; (iii) introduce new versions of any Product; and/or (iv) make iterative changes in  
Product manufacture (including location, method, and raw materials). Seller shall endeavor to provide notice of any such cessation or discontinuation; however, 
advance notice may not be possible, especially if such action is prompted by a governmental directive or suggestion, or if undertaken for the purpose of 
safeguarding human health or safety.
14.Prohibited Parties. Neither Buyer nor any person that directly or indirectly owns 10% or more of the outstanding equity in Buyer (collectively, the "Buyer 
Persons") is, or has been determined by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury to be acting on behalf of, a Specifically Designated National and Blocked Person, or has 
otherwise been designated as (i) a person or entity with whom an entity organized under the laws of the United States is prohibited from entering into transactions 
or (ii) from whom such an entity is prohibited from receiving money or other property or interests in property, pursuant to Executive Orders, regulations 
promulgated by the United States Treasury Department' s Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"), or otherwise. In addition, no Buyer Person is located in, or  
operating from, a country subject to U.S. economic sanctions administered by OFAC. Should Buyer be found in violation of any of the aforementioned obligations, 
Seller may immediately suspend sales and shipments to any and all Buyer facilities and terminate this Agreement without liability and Buyer will indemnify Seller 
for all costs and liabilities arising from such violation.

non-conforming Products at Buyer' s original point of delivery or refund of the purchase price. Notwithstanding any language herein to the contrary, Buyer' s  
exclusive remedy and Seller' s aggregate liability for any and all suit(s), claim(s) or action(s) against Seller arising out of this Contract, including but not limited to  
those related to delivery or non-delivery of product or in tort, is expressly limited to the price for the quantity of the Products causing the occurrence from which 
Buyer claims its damages were caused; and Seller' s total liability under this Contract for all claims, suits, and actions, whether based in contract, tort, or any other  
legal theory or otherwise, shall not exceed $100,000. IN NO EVENT WILL SELLER BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, 
CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS CONTRACT, WHETHER BASED IN TORT, 
CONTRACT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, LOSS OF 
SALES, LOSS OF USE, PRODUCTION DELAYS, OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, AND WHETHER OR NOT EITHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. All legal proceedings by Buyer relating to the Products must be brought within one (1) year following the date of its 
shipment or, with respect to legal proceedings related to non-delivery, the requested delivery date, and Buyer waives all legal proceedings not brought within such 
period and all claims and defenses that could have been asserted in such proceedings. Buyer assumes all risk of liability, in contract or tort, for consequential 
damages, property damage, and personal injury (including death) arising in any way from Buyer' s transportation and storage of the Products and its containers, use  
of the Products, including but not limited to using the Products in manufacturing, combining the Products with other substances, incorporating the Products in 
Buyer' s finished good or product, selling Buyer' s finished good or product, and disposing of the Products and its containers.  Except to the extent of Seller' s willful  
misconduct, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, Buyer shall indemnify, defend, and hold Seller and its employees, shareholders, parents, 
subsidiaries, agents and affiliates harmless from all claims, suits, demands, and actions arising out of or in connection with Buyer' s sale of its own goods (including  
without limitation claims for personal injury, property damage, breach of contract, negligence, strict liability and intellectual property infringement) and all 
damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney' s fees and other legal expenses) arising therefrom.  This provision shall survive termination of this  
Contract and delivery, use, and application of the Products.
8. Force Majeure; Allocation. Seller shall not be liable for the delay of or failure to meet its obligations under this Contract, or the consequences to Buyer, arising

from any event beyond Seller' s control, including but not limited to: inability to obtain (on terms deemed economically and commercially practicable by Seller) raw  
materials, fuel or transportation; fire, floods, inclement weather and other acts of God; strikes, lockouts or other work stoppages; wars; sabotage; accidents; plant 
shut down; equipment failure; currency fluctuation or manipulation; production decisions not made by Wacker Chemical Corporation; and voluntary or involuntary 
compliance with any law. During the period of delay, and in any other times of shortage, Seller is relieved from its obligations hereunder and may allocate 
available Products in a fair and reasonable manner, as Seller determines in its sole discretion, without the obligation to obtain cover, or similar products, from other 
sources. Seller shall have the right to satisfy its own requirements and the requirements of its parent, subsidiary and affiliate companies first. Seller shall endeavor 
to, but has no obligation to, provide notice of any such shortages by issuing a notice of allocation, which may include Product allotment and/or caps.
9.Successors and Assigns. This Contract shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective parties' successors and assigns. Neither party may assign 
this Contract without the prior written consent of the other, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
10.Governing Law; Arbitration. The laws of the State of Tennessee will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Contract. Any dispute or controversy 
arising out of or related to this Contract, other than claims for specific performance or injunctive relief, shall be resolved by binding arbitration, in Hamilton 
County, Tennessee, or such other location agreed upon by Buyer and Seller, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration 
Association in effect at the time of the demand for arbitration. Except with respect to the foregoing , the parties agree to exclusively bring, file, and litigate any 
claims, suits, or actions arising from this Contract or related to the Products in state or federal courts of Hamilton County, Tennessee. The parties hereby disclaim 
the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and expressly agree the same does not apply to the Agreement or the sale of any 
Products by Seller. Unless authorized in writing by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of Seller, the sales hereunder are not subject to 
federal or state contractor status, and the rules and regulations applicable thereto are not contemplated or applicable to Seller or the sale of Product(s) hereunder.
11.Proprietary Rights; Confidentiality. All designs, drawings, specifications, samples and such other proprietary information, whether or not marked as such, made
available by Seller shall be and remain the legal property of Seller, and shall be held confidential by Buyer. Buyer acknowledges Seller' s right to injunctive relief
with respect to the foregoing. Buyer will cease to use such proprietary information upon termination of this Contract and will promptly return to Seller any and all
such designs, drawings, specifications, and all other confidential information and data furnished.
12.Patent Infringement; WACKER Trademarks. Seller shall, at its own expense, defend and control any suit against Buyer for infringement of any United States 
Letters Patent alleging the manufacture of the Products infringe any United States Letters Patent, and shall pay any award of damages assessed against Buyer in the 
suit to the extent only that the damages are awarded in connection specifically with the alleged infringement; however, the foregoing obligations shall not arise 
unless Buyer gives Seller prompt notice in writing of the institution of the suit and, to the full extent of Buyer' s power to do so, Buyer permits Seller to defend and  
control the suit against these allegations. If a suit or claim results in any injunction or order that would reasonably prevent Seller from supplying any Product, Seller 
may, at its option: (i) secure an appropriate license to permit Seller to continue supplying those Products; (ii) modify the appropriate Product so that it becomes
non-infringing; (iii) replace the appropriate Product with a non-infringing but practically equivalent Product; or (iv) provide a refund in the amount of the purchase 
price to Buyer for any Product Buyer has in inventory at the time and is prevented from using. The above fully expresses Buyer' s exclusive remedy and Seller' s  
sole responsibility with respect to infringement or alleged infringement of any intellectual property rights by the Products, and SELLER EXPRESSLY 
DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER WRITTEN OR UNWRITTEN, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WARRANTY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT with respect to the Products.
Buyer understands and agrees that all WACKER branding and product names, including those owned by Seller and/or any of its affiliates, are trademarks and 
subject to protection under the law as such, even if the ® demarcation is not used. Such branding, names, and trademarks may not be used without written 
permission of Seller.
13.Product Improvement; Consolidation; Cessation. Seller may, without liability or obligation and at any time: (i) cease or discontinue the manufacture and/or sale of 
any of the Products;(ii) consolidate Products with other of Seller' s products; (iii) introduce new versions of any Product; and/or (iv) make iterative changes in  
Product manufacture (including location, method, and raw materials). Seller shall endeavor to provide notice of any such cessation or discontinuation; however, 
advance notice may not be possible, especially if such action is prompted by a governmental directive or suggestion, or if undertaken for the purpose of 
safeguarding human health or safety.
14.Prohibited Parties. Neither Buyer nor any person that directly or indirectly owns 10% or more of the outstanding equity in Buyer (collectively, the "Buyer 
Persons") is, or has been determined by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury to be acting on behalf of, a Specifically Designated National and Blocked Person, or has 
otherwise been designated as (i) a person or entity with whom an entity organized under the laws of the United States is prohibited from entering into transactions 
or (ii) from whom such an entity is prohibited from receiving money or other property or interests in property, pursuant to Executive Orders, regulations 
promulgated by the United States Treasury Department' s Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"), or otherwise. In addition, no Buyer Person is located in, or  
operating from, a country subject to U.S. economic sanctions administered by OFAC. Should Buyer be found in violation of any of the aforementioned obligations, 
Seller may immediately suspend sales and shipments to any and all Buyer facilities and terminate this Agreement without liability and Buyer will indemnify Seller 
for all costs and liabilities arising from such violation.

General Terms and Conditions of Sale
1.  Scope of General Terms and Conditions.  These General Terms and Conditions govern all purchase orders and other contracts (individually and collectively, this
"Contract") in which buyer ("Buyer") purchases or accepts goods or products (individually, a "Product" and collectively, the "Products") from Wacker Chemical
Corporation ("Seller"). All other terms of purchase or sale in any purchase order, order confirmation, invoice or other Buyer document are rejected unless expressly
accepted in writing signed by at least two (2) of Seller's authorized signatories.
2.  Payments, Costs, Credit, Quantities, Orders and Disputed Amounts.  Any pricing offered, whether contained herein or in Seller's quotes, order confirmations, or
other documents, is not considered a 'firm offer' under any local, state, or federal law, code, regulation, rule, or statute. Buyer shall pay for each shipment of
Products whether or not Buyer has any claims or defenses arising out of other shipments.  Seller's agreement to ship without payment is an extension of credit that
is a financial accommodation to Buyer and may be stopped or changed at any time at Seller's sole discretion.  Buyer shall reimburse Seller for all taxes, as well as
any additional costs arising from customs, duties, tariffs,  and other governmental charges that are required to be paid on or that are measured by the sale,
production, transportation, or use of any Products. All orders by Buyer shall be in writing via separate purchase orders.  Upon receipt of orders, Seller issues
acknowledgement of receipt.  All orders are subject to Seller's acceptance via an order confirmation containing estimated delivery dates.  Unless otherwise agreed
to in writing by Seller, prices for all orders are contained in Seller's order confirmation.  Orders, once confirmed, cannot be canceled or modified without Seller's
written approval.  Should Seller so agree, change fees may apply.  Seller shall have no obligation to sell and deliver, and Buyer shall have no obligation to purchase,
minimum quantities or volume of Products, except as expressly agreed upon in writing signed by at least two (2) of Seller's authorized signatories. Notwithstanding
any language to the contrary contained in the Contract, if a delivery pursuant to an order confirmation occurs at a time when set pricing is not in effect (e.g. after the
expiration of an agreed upon or initial price period, if any), the parties shall negotiate updated pricing in good faith. Such previously agreed upon pricing shall not
be binding upon Seller if delivery is to occur after the expiration of any previously agreed upon pricing, if any. Buyer shall have no right of "set-off" or withholding
against properly payable invoices issued by Seller or any business affiliated with Seller.  Payment of the purchase price shall be due at the remittance address shown
on the Seller's invoice 30 days following the date of Seller's invoice unless otherwise agreed in writing. Seller may charge interest at a rate of 1 percent per month
on all balances outstanding past the due date.  Buyer shall pay all of Seller's reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable collection agency and attorneys'
fees) to enforce and preserve Seller's rights hereunder.
3.  Defaults.  Buyer will be in default of this Contract if any of the following have occurred: (1) a proceeding under 11 U.S.C. or any other federal or state insolvency
law is started by or against Buyer; (2) Buyer fails to pay for any one or more shipments within the time specified; (3) if, in Seller's estimation, Buyer appears to be
insolvent and/or generally unable to pay its debts when due and Buyer cannot provide adequate assurance of future performance; or (4) Buyer is otherwise in breach
of this Contract. If Buyer defaults, Seller may: (a) stop extending credit, change credit terms or place Buyer on "C.I.A."; (b) suspend further shipments until any
defaults have been cured and Seller has received assurances of future performance satisfactory to Seller; (c) suspend performance; (d) terminate this Contract;
and/or (e) pursue any other right or remedy available at law or in equity. Buyer's default under this or any other agreement between Buyer and Seller shall be
deemed a default under all agreements between Buyer and Seller until such default is cured. Each of the rights and remedies reserved to Seller in this paragraph
shall be cumulative, and Seller's assertion of any right or remedy shall not preclude Seller's assertion of any other rights or remedies.
4.  Shipping; Risk of Loss. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, all Products will be shipped FCA (Incoterms® 2020) from Seller's location. Risk of loss shall pass to
Buyer in accordance with the applicable Incoterm.  Seller shall retain a security interest in the Products until Seller's receipt of payment in full from Buyer.  Any
delivery dates or lead times provided by Seller are estimates only and subject to change without notification.
5.  Suitability of Products Inspection. Determination of the suitability of the Products purchased by Buyer for the use(s) contemplated by Buyer or Buyer's customers
is the sole responsibility of Buyer.  Seller's personnel may advise and/or provide information on the use and/or application of Products; however, any such
information is provided solely for informational purposes and must be assessed and vetted by Buyer.  Seller is a raw material supplier only, and as such, does not
offer consulting or professional services. Products sold to Buyer are for Buyer's internal use only and shall not be resold unless authorized in writing by an
authorized signatory of Seller. In order to mitigate or reduce damages, Buyer is responsible for ensuring all Products received conform to the Contract.  Buyer shall
promptly, and in any event prior to use and/or comingling, inspect Products for any damage to packaging, shortage, or non-conformance to this Contract.  All
claims for damage to packaging, shortage, or non-conformance which could reasonably be discovered in the course of such investigation shall be waived unless
Buyer notifies Seller, in writing, within thirty (30) days following the date of delivery, describing the non-conformity with reasonable specificity.  Failure to
promptly inspect the Products and to notify Seller in writing of non-conforming Products constitutes a waiver of all claims and actions related to the
non-conformity. Buyer shall do all that is necessary or desirable to preserve nonconforming Products for inspection and testing, to avoid incurring damage for any
nonconforming Products, to cooperate with Seller in implementing the remedies under this Contract, and to protect nonconforming Products until Seller has agreed
to the disposition or care of the nonconforming Products.
6.  Compliance with Laws. Buyer agrees to comply with all rules, regulations, ordinances and laws including those relating to Buyer's use of the Products and shall
reimburse Seller for any costs incurred due to Buyer's failure to so comply.
7.  Warranties; Buyer's Remedy; Seller's Liability Limitation.   Buyer is responsible for ensuring that the Products and specifications are adequate for Buyer's needs.
Any Products specification changes shall not bind Seller unless agreed in writing, as evidenced by a document signed by at least two (2) of Seller's authorized
signatories.Seller warrants that the specifications of the Products will be, at delivery, within the upper and lower limits of those technical data fields
reflected on the Certificate of Analysis and/or Inspection Certificate, as applicable, which accompanies the shipment of such Products.  SELLER
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY SERVICES
WARRANTIES OR WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 
Buyer's exclusive remedy, and Seller's sole liability, for non-conforming Products or breach of warranty shall be, at Seller's option, replacement of the
non-conforming Products at Buyer's original point of delivery or refund of the purchase price. Notwithstanding any language herein to the contrary, Buyer's
exclusive remedy and Seller's aggregate liability for any and all suit(s), claim(s) or action(s) against Seller arising out of this Contract, including but not limited to
those related to delivery or non-delivery of product or in tort, is expressly limited to the price for the quantity of the Products causing the occurrence from which
Buyer claims its damages were caused; and Seller's total liability under this Contract for all claims, suits, and actions, whether based in contract, tort, or any other
legal theory or otherwise, shall not exceed $100,000.  IN NO EVENT WILL SELLER BE LIABLE  FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS CONTRACT, WHETHER BASED IN TORT,
CONTRACT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, LOSS OF
SALES, LOSS OF USE, PRODUCTION DELAYS, OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, AND WHETHER OR NOT EITHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. All legal proceedings by Buyer relating to the Products must be brought within one (1) year following the date of its
shipment or, with respect to legal proceedings related to non-delivery, the requested delivery date, and Buyer waives all legal proceedings not brought within such
period and all claims and defenses that could have been asserted in such proceedings. Buyer assumes all risk of liability, in contract or tort, for consequential
damages, property damage, and personal injury (including death) arising in any way from Buyer's transportation and storage of the Products and its containers, use
of the Products, including but not limited to using the Products in manufacturing, combining the Products with other substances, incorporating the Products in
Buyer's finished good or product, selling Buyer's finished good or product, and disposing of the Products and its containers.  Except to the extent of Seller's willful
misconduct, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, Buyer shall indemnify, defend, and hold Seller and its employees, shareholders, parents,
subsidiaries, agents and affiliates harmless from all claims, suits, demands, and actions arising out of or in connection with Buyer's sale of its own goods (including
without limitation claims for personal injury,  property damage, breach of contract, negligence, strict liability and intellectual property infringement) and all
damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and other legal expenses) arising therefrom.  This provision shall survive termination of this
Contract and delivery, use, and application of the Products.
8.  Force Majeure; Allocation. Seller shall not be liable for the delay of or failure to meet its obligations under this Contract, or the consequences to Buyer, arising

from any event beyond Seller's control, including but not limited to: inability to obtain (on terms deemed economically and commercially practicable by Seller) raw
materials, fuel or transportation; fire, floods, inclement weather and other acts of God; strikes, lockouts or other work stoppages; wars; sabotage; accidents; plant
shut down; equipment failure; currency fluctuation or manipulation; production decisions not made by Wacker Chemical Corporation; and voluntary or involuntary

arising out of or related to this Contract, other than claims for specific performance or injunctive relief, shall be resolved by binding arbitration, in Hamilton
County, Tennessee, or such other location agreed upon by Buyer and Seller, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration

DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER WRITTEN OR UNWRITTEN, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WARRANTY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT with respect to the Products.
Buyer understands and agrees that all WACKER branding and product names, including those owned by Seller and/or any of its affiliates, are trademarks and
subject to protection under the law as such, even if the ® demarcation is not used. Such branding, names, and trademarks may not be used without written

General Terms and Conditions of Sale
1.  Scope of General Terms and Conditions.  These General Terms and Conditions govern all purchase orders and other contracts (individually and collectively, this
"Contract") in which buyer ("Buyer") purchases or accepts goods or products (individually, a "Product" and collectively, the "Products") from Wacker Chemical
Corporation ("Seller"). All other terms of purchase or sale in any purchase order, order confirmation, invoice or other Buyer document are rejected unless expressly
accepted in writing signed by at least two (2) of Seller's authorized signatories.
2.  Payments, Costs, Credit, Quantities, Orders and Disputed Amounts.  Any pricing offered, whether contained herein or in Seller's quotes, order confirmations, or
other documents, is not considered a 'firm offer' under any local, state, or federal law, code, regulation, rule, or statute. Buyer shall pay for each shipment of
Products whether or not Buyer has any claims or defenses arising out of other shipments.  Seller's agreement to ship without payment is an extension of credit that
is a financial accommodation to Buyer and may be stopped or changed at any time at Seller's sole discretion.  Buyer shall reimburse Seller for all taxes, as well as
any additional costs arising from customs, duties, tariffs,  and other governmental charges that are required to be paid on or that are measured by the sale,
production, transportation, or use of any Products. All orders by Buyer shall be in writing via separate purchase orders.  Upon receipt of orders, Seller issues
acknowledgement of receipt.  All orders are subject to Seller's acceptance via an order confirmation containing estimated delivery dates.  Unless otherwise agreed
to in writing by Seller, prices for all orders are contained in Seller's order confirmation.  Orders, once confirmed, cannot be canceled or modified without Seller's
written approval.  Should Seller so agree, change fees may apply.  Seller shall have no obligation to sell and deliver, and Buyer shall have no obligation to purchase,
minimum quantities or volume of Products, except as expressly agreed upon in writing signed by at least two (2) of Seller's authorized signatories. Notwithstanding
any language to the contrary contained in the Contract, if a delivery pursuant to an order confirmation occurs at a time when set pricing is not in effect (e.g. after the
expiration of an agreed upon or initial price period, if any), the parties shall negotiate updated pricing in good faith. Such previously agreed upon pricing shall not
be binding upon Seller if delivery is to occur after the expiration of any previously agreed upon pricing, if any. Buyer shall have no right of "set-off" or withholding
against properly payable invoices issued by Seller or any business affiliated with Seller.  Payment of the purchase price shall be due at the remittance address shown
on the Seller's invoice 30 days following the date of Seller's invoice unless otherwise agreed in writing. Seller may charge interest at a rate of 1 percent per month
on all balances outstanding past the due date.  Buyer shall pay all of Seller's reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable collection agency and attorneys'
fees) to enforce and preserve Seller's rights hereunder.
3.  Defaults.  Buyer will be in default of this Contract if any of the following have occurred: (1) a proceeding under 11 U.S.C. or any other federal or state insolvency
law is started by or against Buyer; (2) Buyer fails to pay for any one or more shipments within the time specified; (3) if, in Seller's estimation, Buyer appears to be
insolvent and/or generally unable to pay its debts when due and Buyer cannot provide adequate assurance of future performance; or (4) Buyer is otherwise in breach
of this Contract. If Buyer defaults, Seller may: (a) stop extending credit, change credit terms or place Buyer on "C.I.A."; (b) suspend further shipments until any
defaults have been cured and Seller has received assurances of future performance satisfactory to Seller; (c) suspend performance; (d) terminate this Contract;
and/or (e) pursue any other right or remedy available at law or in equity. Buyer's default under this or any other agreement between Buyer and Seller shall be
deemed a default under all agreements between Buyer and Seller until such default is cured. Each of the rights and remedies reserved to Seller in this paragraph
shall be cumulative, and Seller's assertion of any right or remedy shall not preclude Seller's assertion of any other rights or remedies.
4.  Shipping; Risk of Loss. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, all Products will be shipped FCA (Incoterms® 2020) from Seller's location. Risk of loss shall pass to
Buyer in accordance with the applicable Incoterm.  Seller shall retain a security interest in the Products until Seller's receipt of payment in full from Buyer.  Any
delivery dates or lead times provided by Seller are estimates only and subject to change without notification.
5.  Suitability of Products Inspection. Determination of the suitability of the Products purchased by Buyer for the use(s) contemplated by Buyer or Buyer's customers
is the sole responsibility of Buyer.  Seller's personnel may advise and/or provide information on the use and/or application of Products; however, any such
information is provided solely for informational purposes and must be assessed and vetted by Buyer.  Seller is a raw material supplier only, and as such, does not
offer consulting or professional services. Products sold to Buyer are for Buyer's internal use only and shall not be resold unless authorized in writing by an
authorized signatory of Seller. In order to mitigate or reduce damages, Buyer is responsible for ensuring all Products received conform to the Contract.  Buyer shall
promptly, and in any event prior to use and/or comingling, inspect Products for any damage to packaging, shortage, or non-conformance to this Contract.  All
claims for damage to packaging, shortage, or non-conformance which could reasonably be discovered in the course of such investigation shall be waived unless
Buyer notifies Seller, in writing, within thirty (30) days following the date of delivery, describing the non-conformity with reasonable specificity.  Failure to
promptly inspect the Products and to notify Seller in writing of non-conforming Products constitutes a waiver of all claims and actions related to the
non-conformity. Buyer shall do all that is necessary or desirable to preserve nonconforming Products for inspection and testing, to avoid incurring damage for any
nonconforming Products, to cooperate with Seller in implementing the remedies under this Contract, and to protect nonconforming Products until Seller has agreed
to the disposition or care of the nonconforming Products.
6.  Compliance with Laws. Buyer agrees to comply with all rules, regulations, ordinances and laws including those relating to Buyer's use of the Products and shall
reimburse Seller for any costs incurred due to Buyer's failure to so comply.
7.  Warranties; Buyer's Remedy; Seller's Liability Limitation.   Buyer is responsible for ensuring that the Products and specifications are adequate for Buyer's needs.
Any Products specification changes shall not bind Seller unless agreed in writing, as evidenced by a document signed by at least two (2) of Seller's authorized
signatories.Seller warrants that the specifications of the Products will be, at delivery, within the upper and lower limits of those technical data fields
reflected on the Certificate of Analysis and/or Inspection Certificate, as applicable, which accompanies the shipment of such Products.  SELLER
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY SERVICES
WARRANTIES OR WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 
Buyer's exclusive remedy, and Seller's sole liability, for non-conforming Products or breach of warranty shall be, at Seller's option, replacement of the
non-conforming Products at Buyer's original point of delivery or refund of the purchase price. Notwithstanding any language herein to the contrary, Buyer's
exclusive remedy and Seller's aggregate liability for any and all suit(s), claim(s) or action(s) against Seller arising out of this Contract, including but not limited to
those related to delivery or non-delivery of product or in tort, is expressly limited to the price for the quantity of the Products causing the occurrence from which
Buyer claims its damages were caused; and Seller's total liability under this Contract for all claims, suits, and actions, whether based in contract, tort, or any other
legal theory or otherwise, shall not exceed $100,000.  IN NO EVENT WILL SELLER BE LIABLE  FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS CONTRACT, WHETHER BASED IN TORT,
CONTRACT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, LOSS OF
SALES, LOSS OF USE, PRODUCTION DELAYS, OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, AND WHETHER OR NOT EITHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. All legal proceedings by Buyer relating to the Products must be brought within one (1) year following the date of its
shipment or, with respect to legal proceedings related to non-delivery, the requested delivery date, and Buyer waives all legal proceedings not brought within such
period and all claims and defenses that could have been asserted in such proceedings. Buyer assumes all risk of liability, in contract or tort, for consequential
damages, property damage, and personal injury (including death) arising in any way from Buyer's transportation and storage of the Products and its containers, use
of the Products, including but not limited to using the Products in manufacturing, combining the Products with other substances, incorporating the Products in
Buyer's finished good or product, selling Buyer's finished good or product, and disposing of the Products and its containers.  Except to the extent of Seller's willful
misconduct, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, Buyer shall indemnify, defend, and hold Seller and its employees, shareholders, parents,
subsidiaries, agents and affiliates harmless from all claims, suits, demands, and actions arising out of or in connection with Buyer's sale of its own goods (including
without limitation claims for personal injury,  property damage, breach of contract, negligence, strict liability and intellectual property infringement) and all
damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and other legal expenses) arising therefrom.  This provision shall survive termination of this
Contract and delivery, use, and application of the Products.
8.  Force Majeure; Allocation. Seller shall not be liable for the delay of or failure to meet its obligations under this Contract, or the consequences to Buyer, arising
WCC Terms & Conditions Rev. 7  

               Page 3  of    4

from any event beyond Seller's control, including but not limited to: inability to obtain (on terms deemed economically and commercially practicable by Seller) raw
materials, fuel or transportation; fire, floods, inclement weather and other acts of God; strikes, lockouts or other work stoppages; wars; sabotage; accidents; plant
shut down; equipment failure; currency fluctuation or manipulation; production decisions not made by Wacker Chemical Corporation; and voluntary or involuntary
compliance with any law.  During the period of delay, and in any other times of shortage, Seller is relieved from its obligations hereunder and may allocate
available Products in a fair and reasonable manner,  as Seller determines in its sole discretion, without the obligation to obtain cover, or similar products, from other
sources.  Seller shall have the right to satisfy its own requirements and the requirements of its parent, subsidiary and affiliate companies first. Seller shall endeavor
to, but has no obligation to, provide notice of any such shortages by issuing a notice of allocation, which may include Product allotment and/or caps.
9.  Successors and Assigns.  This Contract shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective parties' successors and assigns.  Neither party may assign
this Contract without the prior written consent of the other, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
10. Governing Law; Arbitration.  The laws of the State of Tennessee will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Contract.  Any dispute or controversy
arising out of or related to this Contract, other than claims for specific performance or injunctive relief, shall be resolved by binding arbitration, in Hamilton
County, Tennessee, or such other location agreed upon by Buyer and Seller, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association in effect at the time of the demand for arbitration.  Except with respect to the foregoing , the parties agree to exclusively bring, file, and litigate  any
claims, suits, or actions arising from this Contract or related to the Products in state or federal courts of Hamilton County, Tennessee. The parties hereby disclaim
the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and expressly agree the same does not apply to the Agreement or the sale of any
Products by Seller. Unless authorized in writing by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of Seller, the sales hereunder are not subject to
federal or state contractor status, and the rules and regulations applicable thereto are not contemplated or applicable to Seller or the sale of Product(s) hereunder.
11.  Proprietary Rights; Confidentiality. All designs, drawings, specifications, samples and such other proprietary information, whether or not marked as such, made
available by Seller shall be and remain the legal property of Seller, and shall be held confidential by Buyer.  Buyer acknowledges Seller's right to injunctive relief
with respect to the foregoing.  Buyer will cease to use such proprietary information upon termination of this Contract and will promptly return to Seller any and all
such designs, drawings, specifications, and all other confidential information and data furnished.
12. Patent Infringement; WACKER Trademarks. Seller shall, at its own expense, defend and control any suit against Buyer for infringement of any United States
Letters Patent alleging the manufacture of the Products infringe any United States Letters Patent, and shall pay any award of damages assessed against Buyer in the
suit to the extent only that the damages are awarded in connection specifically with the alleged infringement;  however, the foregoing obligations shall not arise
unless Buyer gives Seller prompt notice in writing of the institution of the suit and, to the full extent of Buyer's power to do so, Buyer permits Seller to defend and
control the suit against these allegations.  If a suit or claim results in any injunction or order that would reasonably prevent Seller from supplying any Product, Seller
may, at its option: (i) secure an appropriate license to permit Seller to continue supplying those Products; (ii) modify the appropriate Product so that it becomes
non-infringing; (iii) replace the appropriate Product with a non-infringing but practically equivalent Product; or (iv) provide a refund in the amount of the purchase
price to Buyer for any Product Buyer has in inventory at the time and is prevented from using. The above fully expresses Buyer's exclusive remedy and Seller's
sole responsibility with respect to infringement or alleged infringement of any intellectual property rights by the Products, and SELLER EXPRESSLY
DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER WRITTEN OR UNWRITTEN, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WARRANTY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT with respect to the Products.
Buyer understands and agrees that all WACKER branding and product names, including those owned by Seller and/or any of its affiliates, are trademarks and
subject to protection under the law as such, even if the ® demarcation is not used. Such branding, names, and trademarks may not be used without written
permission of Seller.
13. Product Improvement; Consolidation; Cessation.  Seller may, without liability or obligation and at any time: (i) cease or discontinue the manufacture and/or sale of
any of the Products;(ii) consolidate Products with other of Seller's products; (iii) introduce new versions of any Product; and/or (iv) make iterative changes in
Product manufacture (including location, method, and raw materials). Seller shall endeavor to provide notice of any such cessation or discontinuation; however,
advance notice may not be possible, especially if such action is prompted by a governmental directive or suggestion, or if undertaken for the purpose of
safeguarding human health or safety.
14. Prohibited Parties.  Neither Buyer nor any person that directly or indirectly owns 10% or more of the outstanding equity in Buyer (collectively, the "Buyer
Persons") is, or has been determined by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury to be acting on behalf of, a Specifically Designated National and Blocked Person, or has
otherwise been designated as (i) a person or entity with whom an entity organized under the laws of the United States is prohibited from entering into transactions
or (ii) from whom such an entity is prohibited from receiving money or other property or interests in property, pursuant to Executive Orders, regulations
promulgated by the United States Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"), or otherwise. In addition, no Buyer Person is located in, or
operating from, a country subject to U.S. economic sanctions administered by OFAC. Should Buyer be found in violation of any of the aforementioned obligations,
Seller may immediately suspend sales and shipments to any and all Buyer facilities and terminate this Agreement without liability and Buyer will indemnify Seller
for all costs and liabilities arising from such violation.

"Contract") in which buyer ("Buyer") purchases or accepts goods or products (individually, a "Product" and collectively, the "Products") from Wacker Chemical

accepted in writing signed by at least two (2) of Seller's authorized signatories.
2.  Payments, Costs, Credit, Quantities, Orders and Disputed Amounts.  Any pricing offered, whether contained herein or in Seller's quotes, order confirmations, or
other documents, is not considered a 'firm offer' under any local, state, or federal law, code, regulation, rule, or statute. Buyer shall pay for each shipment of

be binding upon Seller if delivery is to occur after the expiration of any previously agreed upon pricing, if any. Buyer shall have no right of "set-off" or withholding
against properly payable invoices issued by Seller or any business affiliated with Seller.  Payment of the purchase price shall be due at the remittance address shown
on the Seller's invoice 30 days following the date of Seller's invoice unless otherwise agreed in writing. Seller may charge interest at a rate of 1 percent per month
on all balances outstanding past the due date.  Buyer shall pay all of Seller's reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable collection agency and attorneys'
fees) to enforce and preserve Seller's rights hereunder.
3.  Defaults.  Buyer will be in default of this Contract if any of the following have occurred: (1) a proceeding under 11 U.S.C. or any other federal or state insolvency
law is started by or against Buyer; (2) Buyer fails to pay for any one or more shipments within the time specified; (3) if, in Seller's estimation, Buyer appears to be
insolvent and/or generally unable to pay its debts when due and Buyer cannot provide adequate assurance of future performance; or (4) Buyer is otherwise in breach
of this Contract. If Buyer defaults, Seller may: (a) stop extending credit, change credit terms or place Buyer on "C.I.A."; (b) suspend further shipments until any
defaults have been cured and Seller has received assurances of future performance satisfactory to Seller; (c) suspend performance; (d) terminate this Contract;
and/or (e) pursue any other right or remedy available at law or in equity. Buyer's default under this or any other agreement between Buyer and Seller shall be
deemed a default under all agreements between Buyer and Seller until such default is cured. Each of the rights and remedies reserved to Seller in this paragraph
shall be cumulative, and Seller's assertion of any right or remedy shall not preclude Seller's assertion of any other rights or remedies.
4.  Shipping; Risk of Loss. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, all Products will be shipped FCA (Incoterms® 2020) from Seller's location. Risk of loss shall pass to
Buyer in accordance with the applicable Incoterm.  Seller shall retain a security interest in the Products until Seller's receipt of payment in full from Buyer.  Any
delivery dates or lead times provided by Seller are estimates only and subject to change without notification.
5.  Suitability of Products Inspection. Determination of the suitability of the Products purchased by Buyer for the use(s) contemplated by Buyer or Buyer's customers
is the sole responsibility of Buyer.  Seller's personnel may advise and/or provide information on the use and/or application of Products; however, any such
information is provided solely for informational purposes and must be assessed and vetted by Buyer.  Seller is a raw material supplier only, and as such, does not
offer consulting or professional services. Products sold to Buyer are for Buyer's internal use only and shall not be resold unless authorized in writing by an
authorized signatory of Seller. In order to mitigate or reduce damages, Buyer is responsible for ensuring all Products received conform to the Contract.  Buyer shall
promptly, and in any event prior to use and/or comingling, inspect Products for any damage to packaging, shortage, or non-conformance to this Contract.  All
claims for damage to packaging, shortage, or non-conformance which could reasonably be discovered in the course of such investigation shall be waived unless
Buyer notifies Seller, in writing, within thirty (30) days following the date of delivery, describing the non-conformity with reasonable specificity.  Failure to
promptly inspect the Products and to notify Seller in writing of non-conforming Products constitutes a waiver of all claims and actions related to the
non-conformity. Buyer shall do all that is necessary or desirable to preserve nonconforming Products for inspection and testing, to avoid incurring damage for any
nonconforming Products, to cooperate with Seller in implementing the remedies under this Contract, and to protect nonconforming Products until Seller has agreed
to the disposition or care of the nonconforming Products.
6.  Compliance with Laws. Buyer agrees to comply with all rules, regulations, ordinances and laws including those relating to Buyer's use of the Products and shall
reimburse Seller for any costs incurred due to Buyer's failure to so comply.
7.  Warranties; Buyer's Remedy; Seller's Liability Limitation.   Buyer is responsible for ensuring that the Products and specifications are adequate for Buyer's needs.
Any Products specification changes shall not bind Seller unless agreed in writing, as evidenced by a document signed by at least two (2) of Seller's authorized
signatories.Seller warrants that the specifications of the Products will be, at delivery, within the upper and lower limits of those technical data fields
reflected on the Certificate of Analysis and/or Inspection Certificate, as applicable, which accompanies the shipment of such Products.  SELLER
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY SERVICES
WARRANTIES OR WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 
Buyer's exclusive remedy, and Seller's sole liability, for non-conforming Products or breach of warranty shall be, at Seller's option, replacement of the
non-conforming Products at Buyer's original point of delivery or refund of the purchase price. Notwithstanding any language herein to the contrary, Buyer's
exclusive remedy and Seller's aggregate liability for any and all suit(s), claim(s) or action(s) against Seller arising out of this Contract, including but not limited to
those related to delivery or non-delivery of product or in tort, is expressly limited to the price for the quantity of the Products causing the occurrence from which
Buyer claims its damages were caused; and Seller's total liability under this Contract for all claims, suits, and actions, whether based in contract, tort, or any other
legal theory or otherwise, shall not exceed $100,000.  IN NO EVENT WILL SELLER BE LIABLE  FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS CONTRACT, WHETHER BASED IN TORT,
CONTRACT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, LOSS OF
SALES, LOSS OF USE, PRODUCTION DELAYS, OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, AND WHETHER OR NOT EITHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. All legal proceedings by Buyer relating to the Products must be brought within one (1) year following the date of its
shipment or, with respect to legal proceedings related to non-delivery, the requested delivery date, and Buyer waives all legal proceedings not brought within such
period and all claims and defenses that could have been asserted in such proceedings. Buyer assumes all risk of liability, in contract or tort, for consequential
damages, property damage, and personal injury (including death) arising in any way from Buyer's transportation and storage of the Products and its containers, use
of the Products, including but not limited to using the Products in manufacturing, combining the Products with other substances, incorporating the Products in
Buyer's finished good or product, selling Buyer's finished good or product, and disposing of the Products and its containers.  Except to the extent of Seller's willful
misconduct, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, Buyer shall indemnify, defend, and hold Seller and its employees, shareholders, parents,
subsidiaries, agents and affiliates harmless from all claims, suits, demands, and actions arising out of or in connection with Buyer's sale of its own goods (including
without limitation claims for personal injury,  property damage, breach of contract, negligence, strict liability and intellectual property infringement) and all
damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and other legal expenses) arising therefrom.  This provision shall survive termination of this
Contract and delivery, use, and application of the Products.
8.  Force Majeure; Allocation. Seller shall not be liable for the delay of or failure to meet its obligations under this Contract, or the consequences to Buyer, arising
WCC Terms & Conditions Rev. 7  

               Page 3  of    4

from any event beyond Seller's control, including but not limited to: inability to obtain (on terms deemed economically and commercially practicable by Seller) raw
materials, fuel or transportation; fire, floods, inclement weather and other acts of God; strikes, lockouts or other work stoppages; wars; sabotage; accidents; plant
shut down; equipment failure; currency fluctuation or manipulation; production decisions not made by Wacker Chemical Corporation; and voluntary or involuntary
compliance with any law.  During the period of delay, and in any other times of shortage, Seller is relieved from its obligations hereunder and may allocate
available Products in a fair and reasonable manner,  as Seller determines in its sole discretion, without the obligation to obtain cover, or similar products, from other
sources.  Seller shall have the right to satisfy its own requirements and the requirements of its parent, subsidiary and affiliate companies first. Seller shall endeavor
to, but has no obligation to, provide notice of any such shortages by issuing a notice of allocation, which may include Product allotment and/or caps.
9.  Successors and Assigns.  This Contract shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective parties' successors and assigns.  Neither party may assign
this Contract without the prior written consent of the other, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
10. Governing Law; Arbitration.  The laws of the State of Tennessee will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Contract.  Any dispute or controversy
arising out of or related to this Contract, other than claims for specific performance or injunctive relief, shall be resolved by binding arbitration, in Hamilton
County, Tennessee, or such other location agreed upon by Buyer and Seller, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association in effect at the time of the demand for arbitration.  Except with respect to the foregoing , the parties agree to exclusively bring, file, and litigate  any
claims, suits, or actions arising from this Contract or related to the Products in state or federal courts of Hamilton County, Tennessee. The parties hereby disclaim
the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and expressly agree the same does not apply to the Agreement or the sale of any
Products by Seller. Unless authorized in writing by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of Seller, the sales hereunder are not subject to
federal or state contractor status, and the rules and regulations applicable thereto are not contemplated or applicable to Seller or the sale of Product(s) hereunder.
11.  Proprietary Rights; Confidentiality. All designs, drawings, specifications, samples and such other proprietary information, whether or not marked as such, made
available by Seller shall be and remain the legal property of Seller, and shall be held confidential by Buyer.  Buyer acknowledges Seller's right to injunctive relief
with respect to the foregoing.  Buyer will cease to use such proprietary information upon termination of this Contract and will promptly return to Seller any and all
such designs, drawings, specifications, and all other confidential information and data furnished.
12. Patent Infringement; WACKER Trademarks. Seller shall, at its own expense, defend and control any suit against Buyer for infringement of any United States
Letters Patent alleging the manufacture of the Products infringe any United States Letters Patent, and shall pay any award of damages assessed against Buyer in the
suit to the extent only that the damages are awarded in connection specifically with the alleged infringement;  however, the foregoing obligations shall not arise
unless Buyer gives Seller prompt notice in writing of the institution of the suit and, to the full extent of Buyer's power to do so, Buyer permits Seller to defend and
control the suit against these allegations.  If a suit or claim results in any injunction or order that would reasonably prevent Seller from supplying any Product, Seller
may, at its option: (i) secure an appropriate license to permit Seller to continue supplying those Products; (ii) modify the appropriate Product so that it becomes
non-infringing; (iii) replace the appropriate Product with a non-infringing but practically equivalent Product; or (iv) provide a refund in the amount of the purchase
price to Buyer for any Product Buyer has in inventory at the time and is prevented from using. The above fully expresses Buyer's exclusive remedy and Seller's
sole responsibility with respect to infringement or alleged infringement of any intellectual property rights by the Products, and SELLER EXPRESSLY
DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER WRITTEN OR UNWRITTEN, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WARRANTY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT with respect to the Products.
Buyer understands and agrees that all WACKER branding and product names, including those owned by Seller and/or any of its affiliates, are trademarks and
subject to protection under the law as such, even if the ® demarcation is not used. Such branding, names, and trademarks may not be used without written
permission of Seller.
13. Product Improvement; Consolidation; Cessation.  Seller may, without liability or obligation and at any time: (i) cease or discontinue the manufacture and/or sale of
any of the Products;(ii) consolidate Products with other of Seller's products; (iii) introduce new versions of any Product; and/or (iv) make iterative changes in
Product manufacture (including location, method, and raw materials). Seller shall endeavor to provide notice of any such cessation or discontinuation; however,
advance notice may not be possible, especially if such action is prompted by a governmental directive or suggestion, or if undertaken for the purpose of
safeguarding human health or safety.
14. Prohibited Parties.  Neither Buyer nor any person that directly or indirectly owns 10% or more of the outstanding equity in Buyer (collectively, the "Buyer
Persons") is, or has been determined by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury to be acting on behalf of, a Specifically Designated National and Blocked Person, or has
otherwise been designated as (i) a person or entity with whom an entity organized under the laws of the United States is prohibited from entering into transactions
or (ii) from whom such an entity is prohibited from receiving money or other property or interests in property, pursuant to Executive Orders, regulations
promulgated by the United States Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"), or otherwise. In addition, no Buyer Person is located in, or
operating from, a country subject to U.S. economic sanctions administered by OFAC. Should Buyer be found in violation of any of the aforementioned obligations,
Seller may immediately suspend sales and shipments to any and all Buyer facilities and terminate this Agreement without liability and Buyer will indemnify Seller
for all costs and liabilities arising from such violation.

General Terms and Conditions of Sale
1.  Scope of General Terms and Conditions.  These General Terms and Conditions govern all purchase orders and other contracts (individually and collectively, this
"Contract") in which buyer ("Buyer") purchases or accepts goods or products (individually, a "Product" and collectively, the "Products") from Wacker Chemical
Corporation ("Seller"). All other terms of purchase or sale in any purchase order, order confirmation, invoice or other Buyer document are rejected unless expressly
accepted in writing signed by at least two (2) of Seller's authorized signatories.
2.  Payments, Costs, Credit, Quantities, Orders and Disputed Amounts.  Any pricing offered, whether contained herein or in Seller's quotes, order confirmations, or
other documents, is not considered a 'firm offer' under any local, state, or federal law, code, regulation, rule, or statute. Buyer shall pay for each shipment of
Products whether or not Buyer has any claims or defenses arising out of other shipments.  Seller's agreement to ship without payment is an extension of credit that
is a financial accommodation to Buyer and may be stopped or changed at any time at Seller's sole discretion.  Buyer shall reimburse Seller for all taxes, as well as
any additional costs arising from customs, duties, tariffs,  and other governmental charges that are required to be paid on or that are measured by the sale,
production, transportation, or use of any Products. All orders by Buyer shall be in writing via separate purchase orders.  Upon receipt of orders, Seller issues
acknowledgement of receipt.  All orders are subject to Seller's acceptance via an order confirmation containing estimated delivery dates.  Unless otherwise agreed
to in writing by Seller, prices for all orders are contained in Seller's order confirmation.  Orders, once confirmed, cannot be canceled or modified without Seller's
written approval.  Should Seller so agree, change fees may apply.  Seller shall have no obligation to sell and deliver, and Buyer shall have no obligation to purchase,
minimum quantities or volume of Products, except as expressly agreed upon in writing signed by at least two (2) of Seller's authorized signatories. Notwithstanding
any language to the contrary contained in the Contract, if a delivery pursuant to an order confirmation occurs at a time when set pricing is not in effect (e.g. after the
expiration of an agreed upon or initial price period, if any), the parties shall negotiate updated pricing in good faith. Such previously agreed upon pricing shall not
be binding upon Seller if delivery is to occur after the expiration of any previously agreed upon pricing, if any. Buyer shall have no right of "set-off" or withholding
against properly payable invoices issued by Seller or any business affiliated with Seller.  Payment of the purchase price shall be due at the remittance address shown
on the Seller's invoice 30 days following the date of Seller's invoice unless otherwise agreed in writing. Seller may charge interest at a rate of 1 percent per month
on all balances outstanding past the due date.  Buyer shall pay all of Seller's reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable collection agency and attorneys'
fees) to enforce and preserve Seller's rights hereunder.
3.  Defaults.  Buyer will be in default of this Contract if any of the following have occurred: (1) a proceeding under 11 U.S.C. or any other federal or state insolvency
law is started by or against Buyer; (2) Buyer fails to pay for any one or more shipments within the time specified; (3) if, in Seller's estimation, Buyer appears to be
insolvent and/or generally unable to pay its debts when due and Buyer cannot provide adequate assurance of future performance; or (4) Buyer is otherwise in breach
of this Contract. If Buyer defaults, Seller may: (a) stop extending credit, change credit terms or place Buyer on "C.I.A."; (b) suspend further shipments until any
defaults have been cured and Seller has received assurances of future performance satisfactory to Seller; (c) suspend performance; (d) terminate this Contract;
and/or (e) pursue any other right or remedy available at law or in equity. Buyer's default under this or any other agreement between Buyer and Seller shall be
deemed a default under all agreements between Buyer and Seller until such default is cured. Each of the rights and remedies reserved to Seller in this paragraph
shall be cumulative, and Seller's assertion of any right or remedy shall not preclude Seller's assertion of any other rights or remedies.
4.  Shipping; Risk of Loss. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, all Products will be shipped FCA (Incoterms® 2020) from Seller's location. Risk of loss shall pass to
Buyer in accordance with the applicable Incoterm.  Seller shall retain a security interest in the Products until Seller's receipt of payment in full from Buyer.  Any
delivery dates or lead times provided by Seller are estimates only and subject to change without notification.
5.  Suitability of Products Inspection. Determination of the suitability of the Products purchased by Buyer for the use(s) contemplated by Buyer or Buyer's customers
is the sole responsibility of Buyer.  Seller's personnel may advise and/or provide information on the use and/or application of Products; however, any such
information is provided solely for informational purposes and must be assessed and vetted by Buyer.  Seller is a raw material supplier only, and as such, does not
offer consulting or professional services. Products sold to Buyer are for Buyer's internal use only and shall not be resold unless authorized in writing by an
authorized signatory of Seller. In order to mitigate or reduce damages, Buyer is responsible for ensuring all Products received conform to the Contract.  Buyer shall
promptly, and in any event prior to use and/or comingling, inspect Products for any damage to packaging, shortage, or non-conformance to this Contract.  All
claims for damage to packaging, shortage, or non-conformance which could reasonably be discovered in the course of such investigation shall be waived unless
Buyer notifies Seller, in writing, within thirty (30) days following the date of delivery, describing the non-conformity with reasonable specificity.  Failure to
promptly inspect the Products and to notify Seller in writing of non-conforming Products constitutes a waiver of all claims and actions related to the
non-conformity. Buyer shall do all that is necessary or desirable to preserve nonconforming Products for inspection and testing, to avoid incurring damage for any
nonconforming Products, to cooperate with Seller in implementing the remedies under this Contract, and to protect nonconforming Products until Seller has agreed
to the disposition or care of the nonconforming Products.
6.  Compliance with Laws. Buyer agrees to comply with all rules, regulations, ordinances and laws including those relating to Buyer's use of the Products and shall
reimburse Seller for any costs incurred due to Buyer's failure to so comply.
7.  Warranties; Buyer's Remedy; Seller's Liability Limitation.   Buyer is responsible for ensuring that the Products and specifications are adequate for Buyer's needs.
Any Products specification changes shall not bind Seller unless agreed in writing, as evidenced by a document signed by at least two (2) of Seller's authorized
signatories.Seller warrants that the specifications of the Products will be, at delivery, within the upper and lower limits of those technical data fields
reflected on the Certificate of Analysis and/or Inspection Certificate, as applicable, which accompanies the shipment of such Products.  SELLER
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY SERVICES
WARRANTIES OR WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 
Buyer's exclusive remedy, and Seller's sole liability, for non-conforming Products or breach of warranty shall be, at Seller's option, replacement of the
non-conforming Products at Buyer's original point of delivery or refund of the purchase price. Notwithstanding any language herein to the contrary, Buyer's
exclusive remedy and Seller's aggregate liability for any and all suit(s), claim(s) or action(s) against Seller arising out of this Contract, including but not limited to
those related to delivery or non-delivery of product or in tort, is expressly limited to the price for the quantity of the Products causing the occurrence from which
Buyer claims its damages were caused; and Seller's total liability under this Contract for all claims, suits, and actions, whether based in contract, tort, or any other
legal theory or otherwise, shall not exceed $100,000.  IN NO EVENT WILL SELLER BE LIABLE  FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS CONTRACT, WHETHER BASED IN TORT,
CONTRACT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, LOSS OF
SALES, LOSS OF USE, PRODUCTION DELAYS, OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, AND WHETHER OR NOT EITHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. All legal proceedings by Buyer relating to the Products must be brought within one (1) year following the date of its
shipment or, with respect to legal proceedings related to non-delivery, the requested delivery date, and Buyer waives all legal proceedings not brought within such
period and all claims and defenses that could have been asserted in such proceedings. Buyer assumes all risk of liability, in contract or tort, for consequential
damages, property damage, and personal injury (including death) arising in any way from Buyer's transportation and storage of the Products and its containers, use
of the Products, including but not limited to using the Products in manufacturing, combining the Products with other substances, incorporating the Products in
Buyer's finished good or product, selling Buyer's finished good or product, and disposing of the Products and its containers.  Except to the extent of Seller's willful
misconduct, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, Buyer shall indemnify, defend, and hold Seller and its employees, shareholders, parents,
subsidiaries, agents and affiliates harmless from all claims, suits, demands, and actions arising out of or in connection with Buyer's sale of its own goods (including
without limitation claims for personal injury,  property damage, breach of contract, negligence, strict liability and intellectual property infringement) and all
damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and other legal expenses) arising therefrom.  This provision shall survive termination of this
Contract and delivery, use, and application of the Products.
8.  Force Majeure; Allocation. Seller shall not be liable for the delay of or failure to meet its obligations under this Contract, or the consequences to Buyer, arising
WCC Terms & Conditions Rev. 7

from any event beyond Seller's control, including but not limited to: inability to obtain (on terms deemed economically and commercially practicable by Seller) raw
materials, fuel or transportation; fire, floods, inclement weather and other acts of God; strikes, lockouts or other work stoppages; wars; sabotage; accidents; plant
shut down; equipment failure; currency fluctuation or manipulation; production decisions not made by Wacker Chemical Corporation; and voluntary or involuntary
compliance with any law.  During the period of delay, and in any other times of shortage, Seller is relieved from its obligations hereunder and may allocate

federal or state contractor status, and the rules and regulations applicable thereto are not contemplated or applicable to Seller or the sale of Product(s) hereunder.
11.  Proprietary Rights; Confidentiality. All designs, drawings, specifications, samples and such other proprietary information, whether or not marked as such, made
available by Seller shall be and remain the legal property of Seller, and shall be held confidential by Buyer.  Buyer acknowledges Seller's right to injunctive relief
with respect to the foregoing.  Buyer will cease to use such proprietary information upon termination of this Contract and will promptly return to Seller any and all
such designs, drawings, specifications, and all other confidential information and data furnished.
12. Patent Infringement; WACKER Trademarks. Seller shall, at its own expense, defend and control any suit against Buyer for infringement of any United States
Letters Patent alleging the manufacture of the Products infringe any United States Letters Patent, and shall pay any award of damages assessed against Buyer in the
suit to the extent only that the damages are awarded in connection specifically with the alleged infringement;  however, the foregoing obligations shall not arise
unless Buyer gives Seller prompt notice in writing of the institution of the suit and, to the full extent of Buyer's power to do so, Buyer permits Seller to defend and
control the suit against these allegations.  If a suit or claim results in any injunction or order that would reasonably prevent Seller from supplying any Product, Seller
may, at its option: (i) secure an appropriate license to permit Seller to continue supplying those Products; (ii) modify the appropriate Product so that it becomes
non-infringing; (iii) replace the appropriate Product with a non-infringing but practically equivalent Product; or (iv) provide a refund in the amount of the purchase
price to Buyer for any Product Buyer has in inventory at the time and is prevented from using. The above fully expresses Buyer's exclusive remedy and Seller's
sole responsibility with respect to infringement or alleged infringement of any intellectual property rights by the Products, and SELLER EXPRESSLY
DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER WRITTEN OR UNWRITTEN, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WARRANTY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT with respect to the Products.
Buyer understands and agrees that all WACKER branding and product names, including those owned by Seller and/or any of its affiliates, are trademarks and
subject to protection under the law as such, even if the ® demarcation is not used. Such branding, names, and trademarks may not be used without written
permission of Seller.
13. Product Improvement; Consolidation; Cessation.  Seller may, without liability or obligation and at any time: (i) cease or discontinue the manufacture and/or sale of
any of the Products;(ii) consolidate Products with other of Seller's products; (iii) introduce new versions of any Product; and/or (iv) make iterative changes in
Product manufacture (including location, method, and raw materials). Seller shall endeavor to provide notice of any such cessation or discontinuation; however,
advance notice may not be possible, especially if such action is prompted by a governmental directive or suggestion, or if undertaken for the purpose of
safeguarding human health or safety.
14. Prohibited Parties.  Neither Buyer nor any person that directly or indirectly owns 10% or more of the outstanding equity in Buyer (collectively, the "Buyer
Persons") is, or has been determined by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury to be acting on behalf of, a Specifically Designated National and Blocked Person, or has
otherwise been designated as (i) a person or entity with whom an entity organized under the laws of the United States is prohibited from entering into transactions
or (ii) from whom such an entity is prohibited from receiving money or other property or interests in property, pursuant to Executive Orders, regulations
promulgated by the United States Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"), or otherwise. In addition, no Buyer Person is located in, or
operating from, a country subject to U.S. economic sanctions administered by OFAC. Should Buyer be found in violation of any of the aforementioned obligations,
Seller may immediately suspend sales and shipments to any and all Buyer facilities and terminate this Agreement without liability and Buyer will indemnify Seller
for all costs and liabilities arising from such violation.

General Terms and Conditions of Sale
1.  Scope of General Terms and Conditions.  These General Terms and Conditions govern all purchase orders and other contracts (individually and collectively, this
"Contract") in which buyer ("Buyer") purchases or accepts goods or products (individually, a "Product" and collectively, the "Products") from Wacker Chemical
Corporation ("Seller"). All other terms of purchase or sale in any purchase order, order confirmation, invoice or other Buyer document are rejected unless expressly
accepted in writing signed by at least two (2) of Seller's authorized signatories.
2.  Payments, Costs, Credit, Quantities, Orders and Disputed Amounts.  Any pricing offered, whether contained herein or in Seller's quotes, order confirmations, or
other documents, is not considered a 'firm offer' under any local, state, or federal law, code, regulation, rule, or statute. Buyer shall pay for each shipment of
Products whether or not Buyer has any claims or defenses arising out of other shipments.  Seller's agreement to ship without payment is an extension of credit that
is a financial accommodation to Buyer and may be stopped or changed at any time at Seller's sole discretion.  Buyer shall reimburse Seller for all taxes, as well as
any additional costs arising from customs, duties, tariffs,  and other governmental charges that are required to be paid on or that are measured by the sale,
production, transportation, or use of any Products. All orders by Buyer shall be in writing via separate purchase orders.  Upon receipt of orders, Seller issues
acknowledgement of receipt.  All orders are subject to Seller's acceptance via an order confirmation containing estimated delivery dates.  Unless otherwise agreed
to in writing by Seller, prices for all orders are contained in Seller's order confirmation.  Orders, once confirmed, cannot be canceled or modified without Seller's
written approval.  Should Seller so agree, change fees may apply.  Seller shall have no obligation to sell and deliver, and Buyer shall have no obligation to purchase,
minimum quantities or volume of Products, except as expressly agreed upon in writing signed by at least two (2) of Seller's authorized signatories. Notwithstanding
any language to the contrary contained in the Contract, if a delivery pursuant to an order confirmation occurs at a time when set pricing is not in effect (e.g. after the
expiration of an agreed upon or initial price period, if any), the parties shall negotiate updated pricing in good faith. Such previously agreed upon pricing shall not
be binding upon Seller if delivery is to occur after the expiration of any previously agreed upon pricing, if any. Buyer shall have no right of "set-off" or withholding
against properly payable invoices issued by Seller or any business affiliated with Seller.  Payment of the purchase price shall be due at the remittance address shown
on the Seller's invoice 30 days following the date of Seller's invoice unless otherwise agreed in writing. Seller may charge interest at a rate of 1 percent per month
on all balances outstanding past the due date.  Buyer shall pay all of Seller's reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable collection agency and attorneys'
fees) to enforce and preserve Seller's rights hereunder.
3.  Defaults.  Buyer will be in default of this Contract if any of the following have occurred: (1) a proceeding under 11 U.S.C. or any other federal or state insolvency
law is started by or against Buyer; (2) Buyer fails to pay for any one or more shipments within the time specified; (3) if, in Seller's estimation, Buyer appears to be
insolvent and/or generally unable to pay its debts when due and Buyer cannot provide adequate assurance of future performance; or (4) Buyer is otherwise in breach
of this Contract. If Buyer defaults, Seller may: (a) stop extending credit, change credit terms or place Buyer on "C.I.A."; (b) suspend further shipments until any
defaults have been cured and Seller has received assurances of future performance satisfactory to Seller; (c) suspend performance; (d) terminate this Contract;
and/or (e) pursue any other right or remedy available at law or in equity. Buyer's default under this or any other agreement between Buyer and Seller shall be
deemed a default under all agreements between Buyer and Seller until such default is cured. Each of the rights and remedies reserved to Seller in this paragraph
shall be cumulative, and Seller's assertion of any right or remedy shall not preclude Seller's assertion of any other rights or remedies.
4.  Shipping; Risk of Loss. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, all Products will be shipped FCA (Incoterms® 2020) from Seller's location. Risk of loss shall pass to
Buyer in accordance with the applicable Incoterm.  Seller shall retain a security interest in the Products until Seller's receipt of payment in full from Buyer.  Any
delivery dates or lead times provided by Seller are estimates only and subject to change without notification.
5.  Suitability of Products Inspection. Determination of the suitability of the Products purchased by Buyer for the use(s) contemplated by Buyer or Buyer's customers
is the sole responsibility of Buyer.  Seller's personnel may advise and/or provide information on the use and/or application of Products; however, any such
information is provided solely for informational purposes and must be assessed and vetted by Buyer.  Seller is a raw material supplier only, and as such, does not
offer consulting or professional services. Products sold to Buyer are for Buyer's internal use only and shall not be resold unless authorized in writing by an
authorized signatory of Seller. In order to mitigate or reduce damages, Buyer is responsible for ensuring all Products received conform to the Contract.  Buyer shall
promptly, and in any event prior to use and/or comingling, inspect Products for any damage to packaging, shortage, or non-conformance to this Contract.  All
claims for damage to packaging, shortage, or non-conformance which could reasonably be discovered in the course of such investigation shall be waived unless
Buyer notifies Seller, in writing, within thirty (30) days following the date of delivery, describing the non-conformity with reasonable specificity.  Failure to
promptly inspect the Products and to notify Seller in writing of non-conforming Products constitutes a waiver of all claims and actions related to the
non-conformity. Buyer shall do all that is necessary or desirable to preserve nonconforming Products for inspection and testing, to avoid incurring damage for any
nonconforming Products, to cooperate with Seller in implementing the remedies under this Contract, and to protect nonconforming Products until Seller has agreed
to the disposition or care of the nonconforming Products.
6.  Compliance with Laws. Buyer agrees to comply with all rules, regulations, ordinances and laws including those relating to Buyer's use of the Products and shall
reimburse Seller for any costs incurred due to Buyer's failure to so comply.
7.  Warranties; Buyer's Remedy; Seller's Liability Limitation.   Buyer is responsible for ensuring that the Products and specifications are adequate for Buyer's needs.
Any Products specification changes shall not bind Seller unless agreed in writing, as evidenced by a document signed by at least two (2) of Seller's authorized
signatories.Seller warrants that the specifications of the Products will be, at delivery, within the upper and lower limits of those technical data fields
reflected on the Certificate of Analysis and/or Inspection Certificate, as applicable, which accompanies the shipment of such Products.  SELLER
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY SERVICES
WARRANTIES OR WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 
Buyer's exclusive remedy, and Seller's sole liability, for non-conforming Products or breach of warranty shall be, at Seller's option, replacement of the
non-conforming Products at Buyer's original point of delivery or refund of the purchase price. Notwithstanding any language herein to the contrary, Buyer's
exclusive remedy and Seller's aggregate liability for any and all suit(s), claim(s) or action(s) against Seller arising out of this Contract, including but not limited to
those related to delivery or non-delivery of product or in tort, is expressly limited to the price for the quantity of the Products causing the occurrence from which
Buyer claims its damages were caused; and Seller's total liability under this Contract for all claims, suits, and actions, whether based in contract, tort, or any other
legal theory or otherwise, shall not exceed $100,000.  IN NO EVENT WILL SELLER BE LIABLE  FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS CONTRACT, WHETHER BASED IN TORT,
CONTRACT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, LOSS OF
SALES, LOSS OF USE, PRODUCTION DELAYS, OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, AND WHETHER OR NOT EITHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. All legal proceedings by Buyer relating to the Products must be brought within one (1) year following the date of its
shipment or, with respect to legal proceedings related to non-delivery, the requested delivery date, and Buyer waives all legal proceedings not brought within such
period and all claims and defenses that could have been asserted in such proceedings. Buyer assumes all risk of liability, in contract or tort, for consequential
damages, property damage, and personal injury (including death) arising in any way from Buyer's transportation and storage of the Products and its containers, use
of the Products, including but not limited to using the Products in manufacturing, combining the Products with other substances, incorporating the Products in
Buyer's finished good or product, selling Buyer's finished good or product, and disposing of the Products and its containers.  Except to the extent of Seller's willful
misconduct, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, Buyer shall indemnify, defend, and hold Seller and its employees, shareholders, parents,
subsidiaries, agents and affiliates harmless from all claims, suits, demands, and actions arising out of or in connection with Buyer's sale of its own goods (including
without limitation claims for personal injury,  property damage, breach of contract, negligence, strict liability and intellectual property infringement) and all
damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and other legal expenses) arising therefrom.  This provision shall survive termination of this
Contract and delivery, use, and application of the Products.
8.  Force Majeure; Allocation. Seller shall not be liable for the delay of or failure to meet its obligations under this Contract, or the consequences to Buyer, arising
WCC Terms & Conditions Rev. 7  

               Page 3  of    4

from any event beyond Seller's control, including but not limited to: inability to obtain (on terms deemed economically and commercially practicable by Seller) raw
materials, fuel or transportation; fire, floods, inclement weather and other acts of God; strikes, lockouts or other work stoppages; wars; sabotage; accidents; plant
shut down; equipment failure; currency fluctuation or manipulation; production decisions not made by Wacker Chemical Corporation; and voluntary or involuntary
compliance with any law.  During the period of delay, and in any other times of shortage, Seller is relieved from its obligations hereunder and may allocate
available Products in a fair and reasonable manner,  as Seller determines in its sole discretion, without the obligation to obtain cover, or similar products, from other
sources.  Seller shall have the right to satisfy its own requirements and the requirements of its parent, subsidiary and affiliate companies first. Seller shall endeavor
to, but has no obligation to, provide notice of any such shortages by issuing a notice of allocation, which may include Product allotment and/or caps.
9.  Successors and Assigns.  This Contract shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective parties' successors and assigns.  Neither party may assign
this Contract without the prior written consent of the other, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
10. Governing Law; Arbitration.  The laws of the State of Tennessee will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Contract.  Any dispute or controversy
arising out of or related to this Contract, other than claims for specific performance or injunctive relief, shall be resolved by binding arbitration, in Hamilton
County, Tennessee, or such other location agreed upon by Buyer and Seller, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association in effect at the time of the demand for arbitration.  Except with respect to the foregoing , the parties agree to exclusively bring, file, and litigate  any
claims, suits, or actions arising from this Contract or related to the Products in state or federal courts of Hamilton County, Tennessee. The parties hereby disclaim
the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and expressly agree the same does not apply to the Agreement or the sale of any
Products by Seller. Unless authorized in writing by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of Seller, the sales hereunder are not subject to
federal or state contractor status, and the rules and regulations applicable thereto are not contemplated or applicable to Seller or the sale of Product(s) hereunder.
11.  Proprietary Rights; Confidentiality. All designs, drawings, specifications, samples and such other proprietary information, whether or not marked as such, made
available by Seller shall be and remain the legal property of Seller, and shall be held confidential by Buyer.  Buyer acknowledges Seller's right to injunctive relief
with respect to the foregoing.  Buyer will cease to use such proprietary information upon termination of this Contract and will promptly return to Seller any and all
such designs, drawings, specifications, and all other confidential information and data furnished.
12. Patent Infringement; WACKER Trademarks. Seller shall, at its own expense, defend and control any suit against Buyer for infringement of any United States
Letters Patent alleging the manufacture of the Products infringe any United States Letters Patent, and shall pay any award of damages assessed against Buyer in the
suit to the extent only that the damages are awarded in connection specifically with the alleged infringement;  however, the foregoing obligations shall not arise
unless Buyer gives Seller prompt notice in writing of the institution of the suit and, to the full extent of Buyer's power to do so, Buyer permits Seller to defend and
control the suit against these allegations.  If a suit or claim results in any injunction or order that would reasonably prevent Seller from supplying any Product, Seller
may, at its option: (i) secure an appropriate license to permit Seller to continue supplying those Products; (ii) modify the appropriate Product so that it becomes
non-infringing; (iii) replace the appropriate Product with a non-infringing but practically equivalent Product; or (iv) provide a refund in the amount of the purchase
price to Buyer for any Product Buyer has in inventory at the time and is prevented from using. The above fully expresses Buyer's exclusive remedy and Seller's
sole responsibility with respect to infringement or alleged infringement of any intellectual property rights by the Products, and SELLER EXPRESSLY
DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER WRITTEN OR UNWRITTEN, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WARRANTY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT with respect to the Products.
Buyer understands and agrees that all WACKER branding and product names, including those owned by Seller and/or any of its affiliates, are trademarks and
subject to protection under the law as such, even if the ® demarcation is not used. Such branding, names, and trademarks may not be used without written
permission of Seller.
13. Product Improvement; Consolidation; Cessation.  Seller may, without liability or obligation and at any time: (i) cease or discontinue the manufacture and/or sale of
any of the Products;(ii) consolidate Products with other of Seller's products; (iii) introduce new versions of any Product; and/or (iv) make iterative changes in
Product manufacture (including location, method, and raw materials). Seller shall endeavor to provide notice of any such cessation or discontinuation; however,
advance notice may not be possible, especially if such action is prompted by a governmental directive or suggestion, or if undertaken for the purpose of
safeguarding human health or safety.
14. Prohibited Parties.  Neither Buyer nor any person that directly or indirectly owns 10% or more of the outstanding equity in Buyer (collectively, the "Buyer
Persons") is, or has been determined by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury to be acting on behalf of, a Specifically Designated National and Blocked Person, or has
otherwise been designated as (i) a person or entity with whom an entity organized under the laws of the United States is prohibited from entering into transactions
or (ii) from whom such an entity is prohibited from receiving money or other property or interests in property, pursuant to Executive Orders, regulations
promulgated by the United States Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"), or otherwise. In addition, no Buyer Person is located in, or
operating from, a country subject to U.S. economic sanctions administered by OFAC. Should Buyer be found in violation of any of the aforementioned obligations,
Seller may immediately suspend sales and shipments to any and all Buyer facilities and terminate this Agreement without liability and Buyer will indemnify Seller
for all costs and liabilities arising from such violation.

General Terms and Conditions of Sale
1.  Scope of General Terms and Conditions.  These General Terms and Conditions govern all purchase orders and other contracts (individually and collectively, this
"Contract") in which buyer ("Buyer") purchases or accepts goods or products (individually, a "Product" and collectively, the "Products") from Wacker Chemical
Corporation ("Seller"). All other terms of purchase or sale in any purchase order, order confirmation, invoice or other Buyer document are rejected unless expressly
accepted in writing signed by at least two (2) of Seller's authorized signatories.
2.  Payments, Costs, Credit, Quantities, Orders and Disputed Amounts.  Any pricing offered, whether contained herein or in Seller's quotes, order confirmations, or
other documents, is not considered a 'firm offer' under any local, state, or federal law, code, regulation, rule, or statute. Buyer shall pay for each shipment of
Products whether or not Buyer has any claims or defenses arising out of other shipments.  Seller's agreement to ship without payment is an extension of credit that
is a financial accommodation to Buyer and may be stopped or changed at any time at Seller's sole discretion.  Buyer shall reimburse Seller for all taxes, as well as
any additional costs arising from customs, duties, tariffs,  and other governmental charges that are required to be paid on or that are measured by the sale,
production, transportation, or use of any Products. All orders by Buyer shall be in writing via separate purchase orders.  Upon receipt of orders, Seller issues
acknowledgement of receipt.  All orders are subject to Seller's acceptance via an order confirmation containing estimated delivery dates.  Unless otherwise agreed
to in writing by Seller, prices for all orders are contained in Seller's order confirmation.  Orders, once confirmed, cannot be canceled or modified without Seller's
written approval.  Should Seller so agree, change fees may apply.  Seller shall have no obligation to sell and deliver, and Buyer shall have no obligation to purchase,
minimum quantities or volume of Products, except as expressly agreed upon in writing signed by at least two (2) of Seller's authorized signatories. Notwithstanding
any language to the contrary contained in the Contract, if a delivery pursuant to an order confirmation occurs at a time when set pricing is not in effect (e.g. after the
expiration of an agreed upon or initial price period, if any), the parties shall negotiate updated pricing in good faith. Such previously agreed upon pricing shall not
be binding upon Seller if delivery is to occur after the expiration of any previously agreed upon pricing, if any. Buyer shall have no right of "set-off" or withholding
against properly payable invoices issued by Seller or any business affiliated with Seller.  Payment of the purchase price shall be due at the remittance address shown
on the Seller's invoice 30 days following the date of Seller's invoice unless otherwise agreed in writing. Seller may charge interest at a rate of 1 percent per month
on all balances outstanding past the due date.  Buyer shall pay all of Seller's reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable collection agency and attorneys'
fees) to enforce and preserve Seller's rights hereunder.
3.  Defaults.  Buyer will be in default of this Contract if any of the following have occurred: (1) a proceeding under 11 U.S.C. or any other federal or state insolvency
law is started by or against Buyer; (2) Buyer fails to pay for any one or more shipments within the time specified; (3) if, in Seller's estimation, Buyer appears to be
insolvent and/or generally unable to pay its debts when due and Buyer cannot provide adequate assurance of future performance; or (4) Buyer is otherwise in breach
of this Contract. If Buyer defaults, Seller may: (a) stop extending credit, change credit terms or place Buyer on "C.I.A."; (b) suspend further shipments until any
defaults have been cured and Seller has received assurances of future performance satisfactory to Seller; (c) suspend performance; (d) terminate this Contract;
and/or (e) pursue any other right or remedy available at law or in equity. Buyer's default under this or any other agreement between Buyer and Seller shall be
deemed a default under all agreements between Buyer and Seller until such default is cured. Each of the rights and remedies reserved to Seller in this paragraph
shall be cumulative, and Seller's assertion of any right or remedy shall not preclude Seller's assertion of any other rights or remedies.
4.  Shipping; Risk of Loss. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, all Products will be shipped FCA (Incoterms® 2020) from Seller's location. Risk of loss shall pass to
Buyer in accordance with the applicable Incoterm.  Seller shall retain a security interest in the Products until Seller's receipt of payment in full from Buyer.  Any
delivery dates or lead times provided by Seller are estimates only and subject to change without notification.
5.  Suitability of Products Inspection. Determination of the suitability of the Products purchased by Buyer for the use(s) contemplated by Buyer or Buyer's customers
is the sole responsibility of Buyer.  Seller's personnel may advise and/or provide information on the use and/or application of Products; however, any such
information is provided solely for informational purposes and must be assessed and vetted by Buyer.  Seller is a raw material supplier only, and as such, does not
offer consulting or professional services. Products sold to Buyer are for Buyer's internal use only and shall not be resold unless authorized in writing by an
authorized signatory of Seller. In order to mitigate or reduce damages, Buyer is responsible for ensuring all Products received conform to the Contract.  Buyer shall
promptly, and in any event prior to use and/or comingling, inspect Products for any damage to packaging, shortage, or non-conformance to this Contract.  All
claims for damage to packaging, shortage, or non-conformance which could reasonably be discovered in the course of such investigation shall be waived unless
Buyer notifies Seller, in writing, within thirty (30) days following the date of delivery, describing the non-conformity with reasonable specificity.  Failure to
promptly inspect the Products and to notify Seller in writing of non-conforming Products constitutes a waiver of all claims and actions related to the
non-conformity. Buyer shall do all that is necessary or desirable to preserve nonconforming Products for inspection and testing, to avoid incurring damage for any
nonconforming Products, to cooperate with Seller in implementing the remedies under this Contract, and to protect nonconforming Products until Seller has agreed
to the disposition or care of the nonconforming Products.
6.  Compliance with Laws. Buyer agrees to comply with all rules, regulations, ordinances and laws including those relating to Buyer's use of the Products and shall
reimburse Seller for any costs incurred due to Buyer's failure to so comply.
7.  Warranties; Buyer's Remedy; Seller's Liability Limitation.   Buyer is responsible for ensuring that the Products and specifications are adequate for Buyer's needs.
Any Products specification changes shall not bind Seller unless agreed in writing, as evidenced by a document signed by at least two (2) of Seller's authorized
signatories.Seller warrants that the specifications of the Products will be, at delivery, within the upper and lower limits of those technical data fields
reflected on the Certificate of Analysis and/or Inspection Certificate, as applicable, which accompanies the shipment of such Products.  SELLER
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY SERVICES
WARRANTIES OR WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 
Buyer's exclusive remedy, and Seller's sole liability, for non-conforming Products or breach of warranty shall be, at Seller's option, replacement of the
non-conforming Products at Buyer's original point of delivery or refund of the purchase price. Notwithstanding any language herein to the contrary, Buyer's
exclusive remedy and Seller's aggregate liability for any and all suit(s), claim(s) or action(s) against Seller arising out of this Contract, including but not limited to
those related to delivery or non-delivery of product or in tort, is expressly limited to the price for the quantity of the Products causing the occurrence from which
Buyer claims its damages were caused; and Seller's total liability under this Contract for all claims, suits, and actions, whether based in contract, tort, or any other
legal theory or otherwise, shall not exceed $100,000.  IN NO EVENT WILL SELLER BE LIABLE  FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS CONTRACT, WHETHER BASED IN TORT,
CONTRACT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, LOSS OF
SALES, LOSS OF USE, PRODUCTION DELAYS, OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, AND WHETHER OR NOT EITHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. All legal proceedings by Buyer relating to the Products must be brought within one (1) year following the date of its
shipment or, with respect to legal proceedings related to non-delivery, the requested delivery date, and Buyer waives all legal proceedings not brought within such
period and all claims and defenses that could have been asserted in such proceedings. Buyer assumes all risk of liability, in contract or tort, for consequential
damages, property damage, and personal injury (including death) arising in any way from Buyer's transportation and storage of the Products and its containers, use
of the Products, including but not limited to using the Products in manufacturing, combining the Products with other substances, incorporating the Products in
Buyer's finished good or product, selling Buyer's finished good or product, and disposing of the Products and its containers.  Except to the extent of Seller's willful
misconduct, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, Buyer shall indemnify, defend, and hold Seller and its employees, shareholders, parents,
subsidiaries, agents and affiliates harmless from all claims, suits, demands, and actions arising out of or in connection with Buyer's sale of its own goods (including
without limitation claims for personal injury,  property damage, breach of contract, negligence, strict liability and intellectual property infringement) and all
damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and other legal expenses) arising therefrom.  This provision shall survive termination of this
Contract and delivery, use, and application of the Products.
8.  Force Majeure; Allocation. Seller shall not be liable for the delay of or failure to meet its obligations under this Contract, or the consequences to Buyer, arising
WCC Terms & Conditions Rev. 7  

               Page 3  of    4

from any event beyond Seller's control, including but not limited to: inability to obtain (on terms deemed economically and commercially practicable by Seller) raw
materials, fuel or transportation; fire, floods, inclement weather and other acts of God; strikes, lockouts or other work stoppages; wars; sabotage; accidents; plant
shut down; equipment failure; currency fluctuation or manipulation; production decisions not made by Wacker Chemical Corporation; and voluntary or involuntary
compliance with any law.  During the period of delay, and in any other times of shortage, Seller is relieved from its obligations hereunder and may allocate
available Products in a fair and reasonable manner,  as Seller determines in its sole discretion, without the obligation to obtain cover, or similar products, from other
sources.  Seller shall have the right to satisfy its own requirements and the requirements of its parent, subsidiary and affiliate companies first. Seller shall endeavor
to, but has no obligation to, provide notice of any such shortages by issuing a notice of allocation, which may include Product allotment and/or caps.
9.  Successors and Assigns.  This Contract shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective parties' successors and assigns.  Neither party may assign
this Contract without the prior written consent of the other, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
10. Governing Law; Arbitration.  The laws of the State of Tennessee will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Contract.  Any dispute or controversy
arising out of or related to this Contract, other than claims for specific performance or injunctive relief, shall be resolved by binding arbitration, in Hamilton
County, Tennessee, or such other location agreed upon by Buyer and Seller, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association in effect at the time of the demand for arbitration.  Except with respect to the foregoing , the parties agree to exclusively bring, file, and litigate  any
claims, suits, or actions arising from this Contract or related to the Products in state or federal courts of Hamilton County, Tennessee. The parties hereby disclaim
the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and expressly agree the same does not apply to the Agreement or the sale of any
Products by Seller. Unless authorized in writing by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of Seller, the sales hereunder are not subject to
federal or state contractor status, and the rules and regulations applicable thereto are not contemplated or applicable to Seller or the sale of Product(s) hereunder.
11.  Proprietary Rights; Confidentiality. All designs, drawings, specifications, samples and such other proprietary information, whether or not marked as such, made
available by Seller shall be and remain the legal property of Seller, and shall be held confidential by Buyer.  Buyer acknowledges Seller's right to injunctive relief
with respect to the foregoing.  Buyer will cease to use such proprietary information upon termination of this Contract and will promptly return to Seller any and all
such designs, drawings, specifications, and all other confidential information and data furnished.
12. Patent Infringement; WACKER Trademarks. Seller shall, at its own expense, defend and control any suit against Buyer for infringement of any United States
Letters Patent alleging the manufacture of the Products infringe any United States Letters Patent, and shall pay any award of damages assessed against Buyer in the
suit to the extent only that the damages are awarded in connection specifically with the alleged infringement;  however, the foregoing obligations shall not arise
unless Buyer gives Seller prompt notice in writing of the institution of the suit and, to the full extent of Buyer's power to do so, Buyer permits Seller to defend and
control the suit against these allegations.  If a suit or claim results in any injunction or order that would reasonably prevent Seller from supplying any Product, Seller
may, at its option: (i) secure an appropriate license to permit Seller to continue supplying those Products; (ii) modify the appropriate Product so that it becomes
non-infringing; (iii) replace the appropriate Product with a non-infringing but practically equivalent Product; or (iv) provide a refund in the amount of the purchase
price to Buyer for any Product Buyer has in inventory at the time and is prevented from using. The above fully expresses Buyer's exclusive remedy and Seller's
sole responsibility with respect to infringement or alleged infringement of any intellectual property rights by the Products, and SELLER EXPRESSLY
DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER WRITTEN OR UNWRITTEN, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WARRANTY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT with respect to the Products.
Buyer understands and agrees that all WACKER branding and product names, including those owned by Seller and/or any of its affiliates, are trademarks and
subject to protection under the law as such, even if the ® demarcation is not used. Such branding, names, and trademarks may not be used without written
permission of Seller.
13. Product Improvement; Consolidation; Cessation.  Seller may, without liability or obligation and at any time: (i) cease or discontinue the manufacture and/or sale of
any of the Products;(ii) consolidate Products with other of Seller's products; (iii) introduce new versions of any Product; and/or (iv) make iterative changes in
Product manufacture (including location, method, and raw materials). Seller shall endeavor to provide notice of any such cessation or discontinuation; however,
advance notice may not be possible, especially if such action is prompted by a governmental directive or suggestion, or if undertaken for the purpose of
safeguarding human health or safety.
14. Prohibited Parties.  Neither Buyer nor any person that directly or indirectly owns 10% or more of the outstanding equity in Buyer (collectively, the "Buyer
Persons") is, or has been determined by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury to be acting on behalf of, a Specifically Designated National and Blocked Person, or has
otherwise been designated as (i) a person or entity with whom an entity organized under the laws of the United States is prohibited from entering into transactions
or (ii) from whom such an entity is prohibited from receiving money or other property or interests in property, pursuant to Executive Orders, regulations
promulgated by the United States Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"), or otherwise. In addition, no Buyer Person is located in, or
operating from, a country subject to U.S. economic sanctions administered by OFAC. Should Buyer be found in violation of any of the aforementioned obligations,
Seller may immediately suspend sales and shipments to any and all Buyer facilities and terminate this Agreement without liability and Buyer will indemnify Seller
for all costs and liabilities arising from such violation.

exclusive remedy and Seller's aggregate liability for any and all suit(s), claim(s) or action(s) against Seller arising out of this Contract, including but not limited to
those related to delivery or non-delivery of product or in tort, is expressly limited to the price for the quantity of the Products causing the occurrence from which
Buyer claims its damages were caused; and Seller's total liability under this Contract for all claims, suits, and actions, whether based in contract, tort, or any other
legal theory or otherwise, shall not exceed $100,000.  IN NO EVENT WILL SELLER BE LIABLE  FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS CONTRACT, WHETHER BASED IN TORT,
CONTRACT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, LOSS OF
SALES, LOSS OF USE, PRODUCTION DELAYS, OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, AND WHETHER OR NOT EITHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. All legal proceedings by Buyer relating to the Products must be brought within one (1) year following the date of its
shipment or, with respect to legal proceedings related to non-delivery, the requested delivery date, and Buyer waives all legal proceedings not brought within such
period and all claims and defenses that could have been asserted in such proceedings. Buyer assumes all risk of liability, in contract or tort, for consequential
damages, property damage, and personal injury (including death) arising in any way from Buyer's transportation and storage of the Products and its containers, use
of the Products, including but not limited to using the Products in manufacturing, combining the Products with other substances, incorporating the Products in
Buyer's finished good or product, selling Buyer's finished good or product, and disposing of the Products and its containers.  Except to the extent of Seller's willful
misconduct, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, Buyer shall indemnify, defend, and hold Seller and its employees, shareholders, parents,
subsidiaries, agents and affiliates harmless from all claims, suits, demands, and actions arising out of or in connection with Buyer's sale of its own goods (including
without limitation claims for personal injury,  property damage, breach of contract, negligence, strict liability and intellectual property infringement) and all
damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and other legal expenses) arising therefrom.  This provision shall survive termination of this
Contract and delivery, use, and application of the Products.
8.  Force Majeure; Allocation. Seller shall not be liable for the delay of or failure to meet its obligations under this Contract, or the consequences to Buyer, arising
WCC Terms & Conditions Rev. 7  

               Page 3  of    4

from any event beyond Seller's control, including but not limited to: inability to obtain (on terms deemed economically and commercially practicable by Seller) raw
materials, fuel or transportation; fire, floods, inclement weather and other acts of God; strikes, lockouts or other work stoppages; wars; sabotage; accidents; plant
shut down; equipment failure; currency fluctuation or manipulation; production decisions not made by Wacker Chemical Corporation; and voluntary or involuntary
compliance with any law.  During the period of delay, and in any other times of shortage, Seller is relieved from its obligations hereunder and may allocate
available Products in a fair and reasonable manner,  as Seller determines in its sole discretion, without the obligation to obtain cover, or similar products, from other
sources.  Seller shall have the right to satisfy its own requirements and the requirements of its parent, subsidiary and affiliate companies first. Seller shall endeavor
to, but has no obligation to, provide notice of any such shortages by issuing a notice of allocation, which may include Product allotment and/or caps.
9.  Successors and Assigns.  This Contract shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective parties' successors and assigns.  Neither party may assign
this Contract without the prior written consent of the other, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
10. Governing Law; Arbitration.  The laws of the State of Tennessee will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Contract.  Any dispute or controversy
arising out of or related to this Contract, other than claims for specific performance or injunctive relief, shall be resolved by binding arbitration, in Hamilton
County, Tennessee, or such other location agreed upon by Buyer and Seller, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association in effect at the time of the demand for arbitration.  Except with respect to the foregoing , the parties agree to exclusively bring, file, and litigate  any
claims, suits, or actions arising from this Contract or related to the Products in state or federal courts of Hamilton County, Tennessee. The parties hereby disclaim
the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and expressly agree the same does not apply to the Agreement or the sale of any
Products by Seller. Unless authorized in writing by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of Seller, the sales hereunder are not subject to
federal or state contractor status, and the rules and regulations applicable thereto are not contemplated or applicable to Seller or the sale of Product(s) hereunder.
11.  Proprietary Rights; Confidentiality. All designs, drawings, specifications, samples and such other proprietary information, whether or not marked as such, made
available by Seller shall be and remain the legal property of Seller, and shall be held confidential by Buyer.  Buyer acknowledges Seller's right to injunctive relief
with respect to the foregoing.  Buyer will cease to use such proprietary information upon termination of this Contract and will promptly return to Seller any and all
such designs, drawings, specifications, and all other confidential information and data furnished.
12. Patent Infringement; WACKER Trademarks. Seller shall, at its own expense, defend and control any suit against Buyer for infringement of any United States
Letters Patent alleging the manufacture of the Products infringe any United States Letters Patent, and shall pay any award of damages assessed against Buyer in the
suit to the extent only that the damages are awarded in connection specifically with the alleged infringement;  however, the foregoing obligations shall not arise
unless Buyer gives Seller prompt notice in writing of the institution of the suit and, to the full extent of Buyer's power to do so, Buyer permits Seller to defend and
control the suit against these allegations.  If a suit or claim results in any injunction or order that would reasonably prevent Seller from supplying any Product, Seller
may, at its option: (i) secure an appropriate license to permit Seller to continue supplying those Products; (ii) modify the appropriate Product so that it becomes
non-infringing; (iii) replace the appropriate Product with a non-infringing but practically equivalent Product; or (iv) provide a refund in the amount of the purchase
price to Buyer for any Product Buyer has in inventory at the time and is prevented from using. The above fully expresses Buyer's exclusive remedy and Seller's
sole responsibility with respect to infringement or alleged infringement of any intellectual property rights by the Products, and SELLER EXPRESSLY
DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER WRITTEN OR UNWRITTEN, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WARRANTY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT with respect to the Products.
Buyer understands and agrees that all WACKER branding and product names, including those owned by Seller and/or any of its affiliates, are trademarks and
subject to protection under the law as such, even if the ® demarcation is not used. Such branding, names, and trademarks may not be used without written
permission of Seller.
13. Product Improvement; Consolidation; Cessation.  Seller may, without liability or obligation and at any time: (i) cease or discontinue the manufacture and/or sale of
any of the Products;(ii) consolidate Products with other of Seller's products; (iii) introduce new versions of any Product; and/or (iv) make iterative changes in
Product manufacture (including location, method, and raw materials). Seller shall endeavor to provide notice of any such cessation or discontinuation; however,
advance notice may not be possible, especially if such action is prompted by a governmental directive or suggestion, or if undertaken for the purpose of
safeguarding human health or safety.
14. Prohibited Parties.  Neither Buyer nor any person that directly or indirectly owns 10% or more of the outstanding equity in Buyer (collectively, the "Buyer
Persons") is, or has been determined by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury to be acting on behalf of, a Specifically Designated National and Blocked Person, or has
otherwise been designated as (i) a person or entity with whom an entity organized under the laws of the United States is prohibited from entering into transactions
or (ii) from whom such an entity is prohibited from receiving money or other property or interests in property, pursuant to Executive Orders, regulations
promulgated by the United States Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"), or otherwise. In addition, no Buyer Person is located in, or
operating from, a country subject to U.S. economic sanctions administered by OFAC. Should Buyer be found in violation of any of the aforementioned obligations,
Seller may immediately suspend sales and shipments to any and all Buyer facilities and terminate this Agreement without liability and Buyer will indemnify Seller
for all costs and liabilities arising from such violation.

General Terms and Conditions of Sale
1.  Scope of General Terms and Conditions.  These General Terms and Conditions govern all purchase orders and other contracts (individually and collectively, this
"Contract") in which buyer ("Buyer") purchases or accepts goods or products (individually, a "Product" and collectively, the "Products") from Wacker Chemical
Corporation ("Seller"). All other terms of purchase or sale in any purchase order, order confirmation, invoice or other Buyer document are rejected unless expressly
accepted in writing signed by at least two (2) of Seller's authorized signatories.
2.  Payments, Costs, Credit, Quantities, Orders and Disputed Amounts.  Any pricing offered, whether contained herein or in Seller's quotes, order confirmations, or
other documents, is not considered a 'firm offer' under any local, state, or federal law, code, regulation, rule, or statute. Buyer shall pay for each shipment of
Products whether or not Buyer has any claims or defenses arising out of other shipments.  Seller's agreement to ship without payment is an extension of credit that
is a financial accommodation to Buyer and may be stopped or changed at any time at Seller's sole discretion.  Buyer shall reimburse Seller for all taxes, as well as
any additional costs arising from customs, duties, tariffs,  and other governmental charges that are required to be paid on or that are measured by the sale,
production, transportation, or use of any Products. All orders by Buyer shall be in writing via separate purchase orders.  Upon receipt of orders, Seller issues
acknowledgement of receipt.  All orders are subject to Seller's acceptance via an order confirmation containing estimated delivery dates.  Unless otherwise agreed
to in writing by Seller, prices for all orders are contained in Seller's order confirmation.  Orders, once confirmed, cannot be canceled or modified without Seller's
written approval.  Should Seller so agree, change fees may apply.  Seller shall have no obligation to sell and deliver, and Buyer shall have no obligation to purchase,
minimum quantities or volume of Products, except as expressly agreed upon in writing signed by at least two (2) of Seller's authorized signatories. Notwithstanding
any language to the contrary contained in the Contract, if a delivery pursuant to an order confirmation occurs at a time when set pricing is not in effect (e.g. after the
expiration of an agreed upon or initial price period, if any), the parties shall negotiate updated pricing in good faith. Such previously agreed upon pricing shall not
be binding upon Seller if delivery is to occur after the expiration of any previously agreed upon pricing, if any. Buyer shall have no right of "set-off" or withholding
against properly payable invoices issued by Seller or any business affiliated with Seller.  Payment of the purchase price shall be due at the remittance address shown
on the Seller's invoice 30 days following the date of Seller's invoice unless otherwise agreed in writing. Seller may charge interest at a rate of 1 percent per month
on all balances outstanding past the due date.  Buyer shall pay all of Seller's reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable collection agency and attorneys'
fees) to enforce and preserve Seller's rights hereunder.
3.  Defaults.  Buyer will be in default of this Contract if any of the following have occurred: (1) a proceeding under 11 U.S.C. or any other federal or state insolvency
law is started by or against Buyer; (2) Buyer fails to pay for any one or more shipments within the time specified; (3) if, in Seller's estimation, Buyer appears to be
insolvent and/or generally unable to pay its debts when due and Buyer cannot provide adequate assurance of future performance; or (4) Buyer is otherwise in breach
of this Contract. If Buyer defaults, Seller may: (a) stop extending credit, change credit terms or place Buyer on "C.I.A."; (b) suspend further shipments until any
defaults have been cured and Seller has received assurances of future performance satisfactory to Seller; (c) suspend performance; (d) terminate this Contract;
and/or (e) pursue any other right or remedy available at law or in equity. Buyer's default under this or any other agreement between Buyer and Seller shall be
deemed a default under all agreements between Buyer and Seller until such default is cured. Each of the rights and remedies reserved to Seller in this paragraph
shall be cumulative, and Seller's assertion of any right or remedy shall not preclude Seller's assertion of any other rights or remedies.
4.  Shipping; Risk of Loss. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, all Products will be shipped FCA (Incoterms® 2020) from Seller's location. Risk of loss shall pass to
Buyer in accordance with the applicable Incoterm.  Seller shall retain a security interest in the Products until Seller's receipt of payment in full from Buyer.  Any
delivery dates or lead times provided by Seller are estimates only and subject to change without notification.
5.  Suitability of Products Inspection. Determination of the suitability of the Products purchased by Buyer for the use(s) contemplated by Buyer or Buyer's customers
is the sole responsibility of Buyer.  Seller's personnel may advise and/or provide information on the use and/or application of Products; however, any such
information is provided solely for informational purposes and must be assessed and vetted by Buyer.  Seller is a raw material supplier only, and as such, does not
offer consulting or professional services. Products sold to Buyer are for Buyer's internal use only and shall not be resold unless authorized in writing by an
authorized signatory of Seller. In order to mitigate or reduce damages, Buyer is responsible for ensuring all Products received conform to the Contract.  Buyer shall
promptly, and in any event prior to use and/or comingling, inspect Products for any damage to packaging, shortage, or non-conformance to this Contract.  All
claims for damage to packaging, shortage, or non-conformance which could reasonably be discovered in the course of such investigation shall be waived unless
Buyer notifies Seller, in writing, within thirty (30) days following the date of delivery, describing the non-conformity with reasonable specificity.  Failure to
promptly inspect the Products and to notify Seller in writing of non-conforming Products constitutes a waiver of all claims and actions related to the
non-conformity. Buyer shall do all that is necessary or desirable to preserve nonconforming Products for inspection and testing, to avoid incurring damage for any
nonconforming Products, to cooperate with Seller in implementing the remedies under this Contract, and to protect nonconforming Products until Seller has agreed
to the disposition or care of the nonconforming Products.
6.  Compliance with Laws. Buyer agrees to comply with all rules, regulations, ordinances and laws including those relating to Buyer's use of the Products and shall
reimburse Seller for any costs incurred due to Buyer's failure to so comply.
7.  Warranties; Buyer's Remedy; Seller's Liability Limitation.   Buyer is responsible for ensuring that the Products and specifications are adequate for Buyer's needs.
Any Products specification changes shall not bind Seller unless agreed in writing, as evidenced by a document signed by at least two (2) of Seller's authorized
signatories.Seller warrants that the specifications of the Products will be, at delivery, within the upper and lower limits of those technical data fields
reflected on the Certificate of Analysis and/or Inspection Certificate, as applicable, which accompanies the shipment of such Products.  SELLER
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY SERVICES
WARRANTIES OR WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 
Buyer's exclusive remedy, and Seller's sole liability, for non-conforming Products or breach of warranty shall be, at Seller's option, replacement of the
non-conforming Products at Buyer's original point of delivery or refund of the purchase price. Notwithstanding any language herein to the contrary, Buyer's
exclusive remedy and Seller's aggregate liability for any and all suit(s), claim(s) or action(s) against Seller arising out of this Contract, including but not limited to
those related to delivery or non-delivery of product or in tort, is expressly limited to the price for the quantity of the Products causing the occurrence from which
Buyer claims its damages were caused; and Seller's total liability under this Contract for all claims, suits, and actions, whether based in contract, tort, or any other
legal theory or otherwise, shall not exceed $100,000.  IN NO EVENT WILL SELLER BE LIABLE  FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS CONTRACT, WHETHER BASED IN TORT,
CONTRACT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, LOSS OF
SALES, LOSS OF USE, PRODUCTION DELAYS, OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, AND WHETHER OR NOT EITHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. All legal proceedings by Buyer relating to the Products must be brought within one (1) year following the date of its
shipment or, with respect to legal proceedings related to non-delivery, the requested delivery date, and Buyer waives all legal proceedings not brought within such
period and all claims and defenses that could have been asserted in such proceedings. Buyer assumes all risk of liability, in contract or tort, for consequential
damages, property damage, and personal injury (including death) arising in any way from Buyer's transportation and storage of the Products and its containers, use
of the Products, including but not limited to using the Products in manufacturing, combining the Products with other substances, incorporating the Products in
Buyer's finished good or product, selling Buyer's finished good or product, and disposing of the Products and its containers.  Except to the extent of Seller's willful
misconduct, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, Buyer shall indemnify, defend, and hold Seller and its employees, shareholders, parents,
subsidiaries, agents and affiliates harmless from all claims, suits, demands, and actions arising out of or in connection with Buyer's sale of its own goods (including
without limitation claims for personal injury,  property damage, breach of contract, negligence, strict liability and intellectual property infringement) and all
damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and other legal expenses) arising therefrom.  This provision shall survive termination of this
Contract and delivery, use, and application of the Products.
8.  Force Majeure; Allocation. Seller shall not be liable for the delay of or failure to meet its obligations under this Contract, or the consequences to Buyer, arising
WCC Terms & Conditions Rev. 7  

               Page 3  of    4

from any event beyond Seller's control, including but not limited to: inability to obtain (on terms deemed economically and commercially practicable by Seller) raw
materials, fuel or transportation; fire, floods, inclement weather and other acts of God; strikes, lockouts or other work stoppages; wars; sabotage; accidents; plant
shut down; equipment failure; currency fluctuation or manipulation; production decisions not made by Wacker Chemical Corporation; and voluntary or involuntary
compliance with any law.  During the period of delay, and in any other times of shortage, Seller is relieved from its obligations hereunder and may allocate
available Products in a fair and reasonable manner,  as Seller determines in its sole discretion, without the obligation to obtain cover, or similar products, from other
sources.  Seller shall have the right to satisfy its own requirements and the requirements of its parent, subsidiary and affiliate companies first. Seller shall endeavor
to, but has no obligation to, provide notice of any such shortages by issuing a notice of allocation, which may include Product allotment and/or caps.
9.  Successors and Assigns.  This Contract shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective parties' successors and assigns.  Neither party may assign
this Contract without the prior written consent of the other, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
10. Governing Law; Arbitration.  The laws of the State of Tennessee will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Contract.  Any dispute or controversy
arising out of or related to this Contract, other than claims for specific performance or injunctive relief, shall be resolved by binding arbitration, in Hamilton
County, Tennessee, or such other location agreed upon by Buyer and Seller, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association in effect at the time of the demand for arbitration.  Except with respect to the foregoing , the parties agree to exclusively bring, file, and litigate  any
claims, suits, or actions arising from this Contract or related to the Products in state or federal courts of Hamilton County, Tennessee. The parties hereby disclaim
the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and expressly agree the same does not apply to the Agreement or the sale of any
Products by Seller. Unless authorized in writing by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of Seller, the sales hereunder are not subject to
federal or state contractor status, and the rules and regulations applicable thereto are not contemplated or applicable to Seller or the sale of Product(s) hereunder.
11.  Proprietary Rights; Confidentiality. All designs, drawings, specifications, samples and such other proprietary information, whether or not marked as such, made
available by Seller shall be and remain the legal property of Seller, and shall be held confidential by Buyer.  Buyer acknowledges Seller's right to injunctive relief
with respect to the foregoing.  Buyer will cease to use such proprietary information upon termination of this Contract and will promptly return to Seller any and all
such designs, drawings, specifications, and all other confidential information and data furnished.
12. Patent Infringement; WACKER Trademarks. Seller shall, at its own expense, defend and control any suit against Buyer for infringement of any United States
Letters Patent alleging the manufacture of the Products infringe any United States Letters Patent, and shall pay any award of damages assessed against Buyer in the
suit to the extent only that the damages are awarded in connection specifically with the alleged infringement;  however, the foregoing obligations shall not arise
unless Buyer gives Seller prompt notice in writing of the institution of the suit and, to the full extent of Buyer's power to do so, Buyer permits Seller to defend and

non-infringing; (iii) replace the appropriate Product with a non-infringing but practically equivalent Product; or (iv) provide a refund in the amount of the purchase
price to Buyer for any Product Buyer has in inventory at the time and is prevented from using. The above fully expresses Buyer's exclusive remedy and Seller's
sole responsibility with respect to infringement or alleged infringement of any intellectual property rights by the Products, and SELLER EXPRESSLY
DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER WRITTEN OR UNWRITTEN, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WARRANTY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT with respect to the Products.
Buyer understands and agrees that all WACKER branding and product names, including those owned by Seller and/or any of its affiliates, are trademarks and
subject to protection under the law as such, even if the ® demarcation is not used. Such branding, names, and trademarks may not be used without written
permission of Seller.
13. Product Improvement; Consolidation; Cessation.  Seller may, without liability or obligation and at any time: (i) cease or discontinue the manufacture and/or sale of
any of the Products;(ii) consolidate Products with other of Seller's products; (iii) introduce new versions of any Product; and/or (iv) make iterative changes in
Product manufacture (including location, method, and raw materials). Seller shall endeavor to provide notice of any such cessation or discontinuation; however,
advance notice may not be possible, especially if such action is prompted by a governmental directive or suggestion, or if undertaken for the purpose of
safeguarding human health or safety.
14. Prohibited Parties.  Neither Buyer nor any person that directly or indirectly owns 10% or more of the outstanding equity in Buyer (collectively, the "Buyer
Persons") is, or has been determined by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury to be acting on behalf of, a Specifically Designated National and Blocked Person, or has
otherwise been designated as (i) a person or entity with whom an entity organized under the laws of the United States is prohibited from entering into transactions
or (ii) from whom such an entity is prohibited from receiving money or other property or interests in property, pursuant to Executive Orders, regulations
promulgated by the United States Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"), or otherwise. In addition, no Buyer Person is located in, or
operating from, a country subject to U.S. economic sanctions administered by OFAC. Should Buyer be found in violation of any of the aforementioned obligations,
Seller may immediately suspend sales and shipments to any and all Buyer facilities and terminate this Agreement without liability and Buyer will indemnify Seller
for all costs and liabilities arising from such violation.

General Terms and Conditions of Sale
1.  Scope of General Terms and Conditions.  These General Terms and Conditions govern all purchase orders and other contracts (individually and collectively, this
"Contract") in which buyer ("Buyer") purchases or accepts goods or products (individually, a "Product" and collectively, the "Products") from Wacker Chemical
Corporation ("Seller"). All other terms of purchase or sale in any purchase order, order confirmation, invoice or other Buyer document are rejected unless expressly
accepted in writing signed by at least two (2) of Seller's authorized signatories.
2.  Payments, Costs, Credit, Quantities, Orders and Disputed Amounts.  Any pricing offered, whether contained herein or in Seller's quotes, order confirmations, or
other documents, is not considered a 'firm offer' under any local, state, or federal law, code, regulation, rule, or statute. Buyer shall pay for each shipment of
Products whether or not Buyer has any claims or defenses arising out of other shipments.  Seller's agreement to ship without payment is an extension of credit that
is a financial accommodation to Buyer and may be stopped or changed at any time at Seller's sole discretion.  Buyer shall reimburse Seller for all taxes, as well as
any additional costs arising from customs, duties, tariffs,  and other governmental charges that are required to be paid on or that are measured by the sale,
production, transportation, or use of any Products. All orders by Buyer shall be in writing via separate purchase orders.  Upon receipt of orders, Seller issues
acknowledgement of receipt.  All orders are subject to Seller's acceptance via an order confirmation containing estimated delivery dates.  Unless otherwise agreed
to in writing by Seller, prices for all orders are contained in Seller's order confirmation.  Orders, once confirmed, cannot be canceled or modified without Seller's
written approval.  Should Seller so agree, change fees may apply.  Seller shall have no obligation to sell and deliver, and Buyer shall have no obligation to purchase,
minimum quantities or volume of Products, except as expressly agreed upon in writing signed by at least two (2) of Seller's authorized signatories. Notwithstanding
any language to the contrary contained in the Contract, if a delivery pursuant to an order confirmation occurs at a time when set pricing is not in effect (e.g. after the
expiration of an agreed upon or initial price period, if any), the parties shall negotiate updated pricing in good faith. Such previously agreed upon pricing shall not
be binding upon Seller if delivery is to occur after the expiration of any previously agreed upon pricing, if any. Buyer shall have no right of "set-off" or withholding
against properly payable invoices issued by Seller or any business affiliated with Seller.  Payment of the purchase price shall be due at the remittance address shown
on the Seller's invoice 30 days following the date of Seller's invoice unless otherwise agreed in writing. Seller may charge interest at a rate of 1 percent per month
on all balances outstanding past the due date.  Buyer shall pay all of Seller's reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable collection agency and attorneys'
fees) to enforce and preserve Seller's rights hereunder.
3.  Defaults.  Buyer will be in default of this Contract if any of the following have occurred: (1) a proceeding under 11 U.S.C. or any other federal or state insolvency
law is started by or against Buyer; (2) Buyer fails to pay for any one or more shipments within the time specified; (3) if, in Seller's estimation, Buyer appears to be
insolvent and/or generally unable to pay its debts when due and Buyer cannot provide adequate assurance of future performance; or (4) Buyer is otherwise in breach
of this Contract. If Buyer defaults, Seller may: (a) stop extending credit, change credit terms or place Buyer on "C.I.A."; (b) suspend further shipments until any
defaults have been cured and Seller has received assurances of future performance satisfactory to Seller; (c) suspend performance; (d) terminate this Contract;
and/or (e) pursue any other right or remedy available at law or in equity. Buyer's default under this or any other agreement between Buyer and Seller shall be
deemed a default under all agreements between Buyer and Seller until such default is cured. Each of the rights and remedies reserved to Seller in this paragraph
shall be cumulative, and Seller's assertion of any right or remedy shall not preclude Seller's assertion of any other rights or remedies.
4.  Shipping; Risk of Loss. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, all Products will be shipped FCA (Incoterms® 2020) from Seller's location. Risk of loss shall pass to
Buyer in accordance with the applicable Incoterm.  Seller shall retain a security interest in the Products until Seller's receipt of payment in full from Buyer.  Any
delivery dates or lead times provided by Seller are estimates only and subject to change without notification.
5.  Suitability of Products Inspection. Determination of the suitability of the Products purchased by Buyer for the use(s) contemplated by Buyer or Buyer's customers
is the sole responsibility of Buyer.  Seller's personnel may advise and/or provide information on the use and/or application of Products; however, any such
information is provided solely for informational purposes and must be assessed and vetted by Buyer.  Seller is a raw material supplier only, and as such, does not
offer consulting or professional services. Products sold to Buyer are for Buyer's internal use only and shall not be resold unless authorized in writing by an
authorized signatory of Seller. In order to mitigate or reduce damages, Buyer is responsible for ensuring all Products received conform to the Contract.  Buyer shall
promptly, and in any event prior to use and/or comingling, inspect Products for any damage to packaging, shortage, or non-conformance to this Contract.  All
claims for damage to packaging, shortage, or non-conformance which could reasonably be discovered in the course of such investigation shall be waived unless
Buyer notifies Seller, in writing, within thirty (30) days following the date of delivery, describing the non-conformity with reasonable specificity.  Failure to
promptly inspect the Products and to notify Seller in writing of non-conforming Products constitutes a waiver of all claims and actions related to the
non-conformity. Buyer shall do all that is necessary or desirable to preserve nonconforming Products for inspection and testing, to avoid incurring damage for any
nonconforming Products, to cooperate with Seller in implementing the remedies under this Contract, and to protect nonconforming Products until Seller has agreed
to the disposition or care of the nonconforming Products.
6.  Compliance with Laws. Buyer agrees to comply with all rules, regulations, ordinances and laws including those relating to Buyer's use of the Products and shall
reimburse Seller for any costs incurred due to Buyer's failure to so comply.
7.  Warranties; Buyer's Remedy; Seller's Liability Limitation.   Buyer is responsible for ensuring that the Products and specifications are adequate for Buyer's needs.
Any Products specification changes shall not bind Seller unless agreed in writing, as evidenced by a document signed by at least two (2) of Seller's authorized
signatories.Seller warrants that the specifications of the Products will be, at delivery, within the upper and lower limits of those technical data fields
reflected on the Certificate of Analysis and/or Inspection Certificate, as applicable, which accompanies the shipment of such Products.  SELLER
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY SERVICES
WARRANTIES OR WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 
Buyer's exclusive remedy, and Seller's sole liability, for non-conforming Products or breach of warranty shall be, at Seller's option, replacement of the
non-conforming Products at Buyer's original point of delivery or refund of the purchase price. Notwithstanding any language herein to the contrary, Buyer's
exclusive remedy and Seller's aggregate liability for any and all suit(s), claim(s) or action(s) against Seller arising out of this Contract, including but not limited to
those related to delivery or non-delivery of product or in tort, is expressly limited to the price for the quantity of the Products causing the occurrence from which
Buyer claims its damages were caused; and Seller's total liability under this Contract for all claims, suits, and actions, whether based in contract, tort, or any other
legal theory or otherwise, shall not exceed $100,000.  IN NO EVENT WILL SELLER BE LIABLE  FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS CONTRACT, WHETHER BASED IN TORT,
CONTRACT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, LOSS OF
SALES, LOSS OF USE, PRODUCTION DELAYS, OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, AND WHETHER OR NOT EITHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. All legal proceedings by Buyer relating to the Products must be brought within one (1) year following the date of its
shipment or, with respect to legal proceedings related to non-delivery, the requested delivery date, and Buyer waives all legal proceedings not brought within such
period and all claims and defenses that could have been asserted in such proceedings. Buyer assumes all risk of liability, in contract or tort, for consequential
damages, property damage, and personal injury (including death) arising in any way from Buyer's transportation and storage of the Products and its containers, use
of the Products, including but not limited to using the Products in manufacturing, combining the Products with other substances, incorporating the Products in
Buyer's finished good or product, selling Buyer's finished good or product, and disposing of the Products and its containers.  Except to the extent of Seller's willful
misconduct, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, Buyer shall indemnify, defend, and hold Seller and its employees, shareholders, parents,
subsidiaries, agents and affiliates harmless from all claims, suits, demands, and actions arising out of or in connection with Buyer's sale of its own goods (including
without limitation claims for personal injury,  property damage, breach of contract, negligence, strict liability and intellectual property infringement) and all
damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and other legal expenses) arising therefrom.  This provision shall survive termination of this
Contract and delivery, use, and application of the Products.
8.  Force Majeure; Allocation. Seller shall not be liable for the delay of or failure to meet its obligations under this Contract, or the consequences to Buyer, arising
WCC Terms & Conditions Rev. 7  

               Page 3  of    4

from any event beyond Seller's control, including but not limited to: inability to obtain (on terms deemed economically and commercially practicable by Seller) raw
materials, fuel or transportation; fire, floods, inclement weather and other acts of God; strikes, lockouts or other work stoppages; wars; sabotage; accidents; plant
shut down; equipment failure; currency fluctuation or manipulation; production decisions not made by Wacker Chemical Corporation; and voluntary or involuntary
compliance with any law.  During the period of delay, and in any other times of shortage, Seller is relieved from its obligations hereunder and may allocate
available Products in a fair and reasonable manner,  as Seller determines in its sole discretion, without the obligation to obtain cover, or similar products, from other
sources.  Seller shall have the right to satisfy its own requirements and the requirements of its parent, subsidiary and affiliate companies first. Seller shall endeavor
to, but has no obligation to, provide notice of any such shortages by issuing a notice of allocation, which may include Product allotment and/or caps.
9.  Successors and Assigns.  This Contract shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective parties' successors and assigns.  Neither party may assign
this Contract without the prior written consent of the other, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
10. Governing Law; Arbitration.  The laws of the State of Tennessee will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Contract.  Any dispute or controversy
arising out of or related to this Contract, other than claims for specific performance or injunctive relief, shall be resolved by binding arbitration, in Hamilton
County, Tennessee, or such other location agreed upon by Buyer and Seller, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association in effect at the time of the demand for arbitration.  Except with respect to the foregoing , the parties agree to exclusively bring, file, and litigate  any
claims, suits, or actions arising from this Contract or related to the Products in state or federal courts of Hamilton County, Tennessee. The parties hereby disclaim
the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and expressly agree the same does not apply to the Agreement or the sale of any
Products by Seller. Unless authorized in writing by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of Seller, the sales hereunder are not subject to
federal or state contractor status, and the rules and regulations applicable thereto are not contemplated or applicable to Seller or the sale of Product(s) hereunder.
11.  Proprietary Rights; Confidentiality. All designs, drawings, specifications, samples and such other proprietary information, whether or not marked as such, made
available by Seller shall be and remain the legal property of Seller, and shall be held confidential by Buyer.  Buyer acknowledges Seller's right to injunctive relief
with respect to the foregoing.  Buyer will cease to use such proprietary information upon termination of this Contract and will promptly return to Seller any and all
such designs, drawings, specifications, and all other confidential information and data furnished.
12. Patent Infringement; WACKER Trademarks. Seller shall, at its own expense, defend and control any suit against Buyer for infringement of any United States
Letters Patent alleging the manufacture of the Products infringe any United States Letters Patent, and shall pay any award of damages assessed against Buyer in the
suit to the extent only that the damages are awarded in connection specifically with the alleged infringement;  however, the foregoing obligations shall not arise
unless Buyer gives Seller prompt notice in writing of the institution of the suit and, to the full extent of Buyer's power to do so, Buyer permits Seller to defend and
control the suit against these allegations.  If a suit or claim results in any injunction or order that would reasonably prevent Seller from supplying any Product, Seller
may, at its option: (i) secure an appropriate license to permit Seller to continue supplying those Products; (ii) modify the appropriate Product so that it becomes
non-infringing; (iii) replace the appropriate Product with a non-infringing but practically equivalent Product; or (iv) provide a refund in the amount of the purchase
price to Buyer for any Product Buyer has in inventory at the time and is prevented from using. The above fully expresses Buyer's exclusive remedy and Seller's
sole responsibility with respect to infringement or alleged infringement of any intellectual property rights by the Products, and SELLER EXPRESSLY
DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER WRITTEN OR UNWRITTEN, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WARRANTY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT with respect to the Products.
Buyer understands and agrees that all WACKER branding and product names, including those owned by Seller and/or any of its affiliates, are trademarks and
subject to protection under the law as such, even if the ® demarcation is not used. Such branding, names, and trademarks may not be used without written
permission of Seller.
13. Product Improvement; Consolidation; Cessation.  Seller may, without liability or obligation and at any time: (i) cease or discontinue the manufacture and/or sale of
any of the Products;(ii) consolidate Products with other of Seller's products; (iii) introduce new versions of any Product; and/or (iv) make iterative changes in
Product manufacture (including location, method, and raw materials). Seller shall endeavor to provide notice of any such cessation or discontinuation; however,
advance notice may not be possible, especially if such action is prompted by a governmental directive or suggestion, or if undertaken for the purpose of
safeguarding human health or safety.
14. Prohibited Parties.  Neither Buyer nor any person that directly or indirectly owns 10% or more of the outstanding equity in Buyer (collectively, the "Buyer
Persons") is, or has been determined by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury to be acting on behalf of, a Specifically Designated National and Blocked Person, or has
otherwise been designated as (i) a person or entity with whom an entity organized under the laws of the United States is prohibited from entering into transactions
or (ii) from whom such an entity is prohibited from receiving money or other property or interests in property, pursuant to Executive Orders, regulations
promulgated by the United States Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"), or otherwise. In addition, no Buyer Person is located in, or
operating from, a country subject to U.S. economic sanctions administered by OFAC. Should Buyer be found in violation of any of the aforementioned obligations,
Seller may immediately suspend sales and shipments to any and all Buyer facilities and terminate this Agreement without liability and Buyer will indemnify Seller
for all costs and liabilities arising from such violation.
